# Human legacy:

In the event of my death or inability to continue providing this website, it would be nice if someone else could re-use it to provide its helpful information to the world. A lot of work went into both the information and coding.

In the event that the domain dartmoorwalking.org expires and you wish to re-use these files either in part or entirely, please email digdilem@gmail.com AND simon@digdilem.org.
In the event of no reply from me or my next of kin within 30 days, consider these files public domain.

Thank you. Simon Avery, Christmas 2024

Outline:

* Hugo. Run from the root, and repopulates ./public with the static files required for the website.
* Credit for the theme "Stack" by Jimmy. (Modified somewhat)
* Use scripts/walks_deploy.sh to build, as this also generates the html for the map and rebuilds the all-gpx zipfile
