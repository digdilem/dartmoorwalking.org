To cut down on transport, the bankers typically set up very close by to the raw material, and their workplaces - bankers - were rough and ready; somewhere to stand and work the stone at around waist level.</p><p>In exposed conditions, and this certainly qualifies, they would erect shelters to keep off the rain, snow and the worst of the wind. These would have been made of oilskin tarpaulin with a stick framework, probably on three sides, backed to the wind.</p><p>The tools were iron chisels and a hammer, with the working stone set on a bed on firm earth and granite chips, which would absorb the blows.</p><p>It was a hard job. As well as the obvious difficulties of weather and repetitive, physical work; the sett-maker&rsquo;s hearing will have suffered and worse, many will have suffered from silicosis from working granite and died early from lung problems.</p><p>The stone here is the waste rock - where setts failed, often through cracks in the rock or where edges were trimmed off.</p><p>Traditional stonemasons still work very similarly to this, but now have tungsten tipped chisels and, when working with granite, a full-face respirator system.</p><blockquote><p>When I worked for DNPA in the late 1980s, they often employed a traditional stonemason who would work just inside the entrance of the Works Depot in Bovey Tracey. He had a 45 gallon oil drum full of granite chips on which he&rsquo;d place his work, which might be a perfectly spherical ball to sit atop a gatepost. He&rsquo;d stand there all day, chipping away. Pausing every now and then to offer up a hardboard template to check his progress, or check diameter with a set of large calipers. He wore a full face respirator, with a battery pack and inlet on his belt at the back, similar to those used by industrial welders, which blew filtered air into the mask. <cite>&ndash; Simon</cite></p></blockquote><h2 id=foggintor-quarry>Foggintor Quarry</h2><p><img src=/p/foggintor-quarry/13.jpg width=1600 height=900 srcset="/p/foggintor-quarry/13_hu_e0fa0c9cfb8b503f.jpg 480w, /p/foggintor-quarry/13_hu_fa8e15d6e70507fe.jpg 1024w" loading=lazy alt="A view ahead of Foggintor from the sett making site" class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=177 data-flex-basis=426px></p><p>The &ldquo;bumps&rdquo; on the left skyline are high-level waste tips while the enormous waste tip to the right is named &ldquo;Big Tip&rdquo;.</p><p>Royal Oak Quarry (later known as Foggintor) was worked from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, extracting granite that was taken away on the nearby railway line. This track was a horse-driven rail or tramway, so some deliveries will also have left this way to the road, as well as bringing supplies into the quarry and its accompanying village.</p><p>Remains on the site include ruins of numerous buildings, large spoil tips and tracks, including that leading to the nearby Swell Tor Quarry, was closely associated. Foggintor was known to have included up to 30 cottages, a large Manager&rsquo;s house, smithy, powder house, dressing sheds and stables.</p><ul><li>The Quarry was first dug in 1820, then known as Royal Oak Quarry.</li><li>Through the 1830s through 1840s, up to 600 men were employed by the local quarries, some living at Foggintor and most journeying in each day.</li><li>In the 1861 Census, 267 people were registered as living at Foggintor.</li><li>As well as Foggintor, Hill Quarry and Royal Oak Quarry, this was also known as Foggator - probably a local dialect corruption.</li><li>The Houses of Parliament and Nelson&rsquo;s Column were built from granite taken from this quarry.</li><li>More locally, stone from here was used to build Tor Royal at Princetown, and likely some other Princetown buildings, although the Prison&rsquo;s stone was mostly dug from the nearer Herne Hole Quarry.</li><li>Foggintor Quarry was owned at one time by the Johnson Brothers who also took the lease on Haytor Quarry, but closed it and then sold stone from Foggintor Quarry under Haytor&rsquo;s name.</li><li>The quarry closed in 1966, putting 40 men out of work. One factor given was competition from cheaper sources abroad, and an increasing use of concrete instead of stone in architecture.</li><li>The stones that form Big Tip are huge, especially on the lower levels. Approaching from the side you can see some must weigh many tons, and cracks in between are big enough to easily conceal an adult.</li></ul><p><img src=/p/foggintor-quarry/14.jpg width=1600 height=900 srcset="/p/foggintor-quarry/14_hu_79ae44e65c34a9c8.jpg 480w, /p/foggintor-quarry/14_hu_c81b6485a921bfb5.jpg 1024w" loading=lazy alt="A zoomed view of ruins at Hill Cottages, on Big Tip" class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=177 data-flex-basis=426px></p><p><img src=/p/foggintor-quarry/15.jpg width=1600 height=900 srcset="/p/foggintor-quarry/15_hu_fdf792dd4f20e445.jpg 480w, /p/foggintor-quarry/15_hu_231fc3482971084b.jpg 1024w" loading=lazy alt="The TA stone (the Medieval Tavistock-Ashburton packhorse track) incorporated into a now-blocked up gateway, at SX 56718 74141.
