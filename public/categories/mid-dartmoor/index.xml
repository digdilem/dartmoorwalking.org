&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This short walk starts at the Highest Pub in Southern England and climbs the gentle hill behind it, visiting several ancient sites on the way such as the Kings&amp;rsquo; Oven to the impressive Hurston Stone Row. We then return along along a low ridge to another cairn atop Water Hill, before dropping back down to the starting point. The views are impressive, and although never far from the road, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to lose sight of modernity and step back in time in one&amp;rsquo;s imagination to when this area was a thriving tin mining valley, or even further back to the bronze age when it was also busy with several nearby settlements.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This pub claims to be the most famous pub on Dartmoor and is certainly one of the most visited, especially on Summer&amp;rsquo;s day. When the prison was working, visitors would often stop by here on their way to visit friends and relatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At 434m above sea level, it&amp;rsquo;s the highest pub in Southern England and the second highest overall. It claims to have kept its fire burning continuously since 1845, which must make for exciting work as the pub&amp;rsquo;s chimney sweep.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally named New House and built in 1751, it was then positioned on the opposite side of the road where the foundations can still be seen. In 1845, the pub was rebuilt and renamed to the &amp;ldquo;Moreton Inn&amp;rdquo; to serve the thriving tin mining industry that was literally on its doorstep, with Vitifer and Golden Dagger mines only a short distance downhill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shortly afterwards it was renamed to its present title for the Headland Warren that was built nearby to give the miners a steady supply of meat.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The letters WB are difficult to see now, occupying the upper six inches on the face of the stone. This is one of a series of 15 similar stones that mark the bounds of Headland Warren, where rabbits were bred to feed the miners. Warren House Inn is named after the warren. The &amp;ldquo;15&amp;rdquo; bound stones includes the large Bennet&amp;rsquo;s Cross, which stands tall and proud to the side of the road, also marked &amp;ldquo;WB&amp;rdquo;. The stones date from around 1780 &lt;cite> &amp;ndash; (Dave Brewer, 2002, Dartmoor Boundary Markers, pp. 265-268)&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Benet’s Cross stands at the roadside, a tall roughly hewn cross with a distinctive bend in the shaft, inscribed on its north face the letters ‘WB’. The original purpose of the cross is uncertain — it may have been a route guide post, or a bond mark of lands owned by Buckfast Abbey, or perhaps both. The name should be spelt with a single ‘n’ and a single ‘t’ — though few people seem to do so — for it is derived from the Benedictine order of monks, indicating its former association with the original monastery at Buckfast — this was at first a Benedictine abbey, as also is the present one, but was a Cistercian monastery from the thirteenth century until the Dissolution. The cross also acted not only as a boundary marker for Headland Warren, to which the letters refer (WB = Warren Bounds), but also for the Vitifer and Birch Tor mining setts, as well as being a bond mark on the Chagford/North Bovey parish line, a purpose which it still serves today. A curious coincidence is the fact that a William Bennett was a representative of Chagford Stannary in the time of King Henry VIII, and he would have undoubtedly had some indirect connections with the earliest tin-streaming activities in the area.&amp;rdquo; &lt;cite>&amp;mdash; Mike Brown (2001) Guide to Dartmoor&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>This green cast iron item is a Telegraph Marker. There are thirteen of these items between Moretonhampstead and Tavistock. They marked the route of underground telegraph cables placed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After bad blizzards of 1891, a need was seen to create more reliable communications after overhead telegraph cables were damaged and made inoperable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The start of the walk is an ancient trackway to the open workings of the Water Hill Mine that has extensive diggings on this hillside. There is a large gert (A mining remain where tin was washed out of the rock) right behind the Warren House Inn that approaches from the west - this being the direction of the Caroline Mine. The Water Hill MIne workings extend rightwards in this photograph, towards Moretonhampstead, towards the workings of Bushdown Mine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s mysteries, the V stones - no-one knows what these are. It has been suggested they might be for the base of machinery, the base of a flagpole, a mould and I&amp;rsquo;m sure, many other things. (See plan below for location)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Two theories:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The DTRG (Dartmoor Tinworking Research Group) Newsletter May 2020 No. 58 has a note on the &amp;ldquo;Kings Oven Stones&amp;rdquo; by Nick Walter on pages 9-10 that proposes a possible function for these stones. They could have been supports for a hand windlass that could have been used for raising loads from a small shaft in the nearby mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The next issue of the same DTRG Newsletter, dated November 2020 No. 59, has a note on the &amp;ldquo;Kings Oven Stones&amp;rdquo; by Tom Greaves on page 19. The stones may have derive from a single stone that is now broken. The cut recesses could have house the base (wood or metal) of a flagpole. They are situated near the foundations of the larger of two ruined buildings which might have been the mine office. It is recorded that at least one mine in this area flew such a flag when they were actively working.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>King&amp;rsquo;s Oven or Furnum Regis (in Latin). This derives from the fact that this is thought to be the site of an early smelting house, hence &amp;ldquo;oven&amp;rdquo;, the produce of which would be taxed by the King via the stannary towns, such as Chagford. Furnum Regis appears in the 1240 Perambulation of Dartmoor, although more likely mistaken for the landmark cairn at the summit of Water Hill.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Description: &amp;ldquo;The enclosure at King&amp;rsquo;s Oven is probably the site of medieval tin mining activities. Burnard comments that &amp;rsquo;the enclosure is circular and an acre in extent&amp;rsquo;. Burnard notes that the stone &amp;rsquo;looks something like the nether stone of a crazing mill&amp;rsquo;. A nether stone is the lower stone of a rotary crazing mill that was used for grinding tin ore. Crazing mills could only grind the alluvial gravels and they were replaced by stamping mills when coarser ores started being mined. In Newman&amp;rsquo;s //Dartmoor Tin Industry Field Guide// he states that only three crazing mills are known on Dartmoor at Sheepstor, Outcombe and Gobbet. Perhaps the stone photographed by Burnard in 1888 is evidence for a fourth crazing mill but the stone is no longer in situ today. King&amp;rsquo;s Oven was previously known as Furnum Regis and was mentioned by this name in a Perambulation of Henry III in 1240. However by 1609 in the Dartmoor Forestry Survey the location was known as King&amp;rsquo;s Oven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The fact that Furnum Regis, the King&amp;rsquo;s Oven (taken to imply a smelting place for tin), is a landmark in the 1240 Perambulation shows that tin was important as far back as the 1200s. The diggings in the area must date from that period - 800 years ago!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Somewhere in this area is a &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; cairn described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities. The cairn was discovered and excavated by the Dartmoor Exploration Committee in 1900 and then it was &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; again, shortly afterwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During investigations on the cairn by Baring Gould, a &amp;ldquo;stone axe and a cinerary urn&amp;rdquo; (the latter upturned and covering a small heap of cremated bones on a flat stone, covered by a slab) were found. A photo of the restored Middle Bronze Age urn (1500-1000 BC) can be seen &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/Images3/Hurstone.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here (Credit: Legendary Dartmoor)&lt;/a> The pattern around the rim is believed made by impressing the clay with a twisted cord. It was restored 1960-1962 and was put on display in the Plymouth Museum.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>It is assumed that this landmark cairn, which is visible for some distance, is the &amp;ldquo;Furnum Regis&amp;rdquo; mentioned in the 1240 Perambulation of Dartmoor. This was occasioned by order of King Henry III when he granted the lands of the Forest of Dartmoor to his brother Richard. It was decreed that the Sheriff of Devon should do this accompanied by twelve knights and their attendants. Richard became an Earl in 1225 and was known as Richard of Cornwall (died 1272, aged 63)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Legend records that there are four fields, each one shaped for the suites of a pack of cards. A young tin mining wastrel, name of Jan Reynolds, dared to play cards during a church sermon. The Devil descended and bore Jan away on his large and fierce black horse, never to be seen again. As he was bourne away, Jan dropped his cards, forming these enclosures. (Full story at the link below)&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>The less prosaic reality is that they were farming enclosures used to grow vegetables for the nearby mines.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is an open walk taking in some lesser visited ancient items on its circuitous way to the much more famous Dunnabridge Pound.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On arrival at the car park, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to find it half full of Ponies. This particular herd is often a mix of Dartmoor Hill Ponies and the smaller Shetland Ponies, both ideally suited to the moor. Unfortunately, they are over-friendly due to people feeding them, which can lead to aggression from them and people being bitten is common. Please don&amp;rsquo;t feed them or otherwise encourage them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with many Dartmoor car parks, ponies will run on parked cars, especially during the moulting times of Spring and Summer when they get very itchy from their coat changing. Dents to body panels and broken mirrors are common! If you can, fold in your wing mirrors when parking on the moor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>A brief note about Dartmoor Ponies by Simon&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above mare (photo taken in 2009) is likely a Registered Dartmoor Pony as it looks to be very close to the breed standard. Every pony on Dartmoor is owned by someone with a set number of grazing rights allowing them to use certain parts of the moor for this purpose. This is governed by the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dartmoorcommonerscouncil.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dartmoor Commoners Council&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some owners take great pride in their herds and breed to improve certain strains, and ponies can be split into roughly four types;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Registered Dartmoors: These are pedigree ponies that are Registered with the &lt;a class="link" href="https://dartmoorponysociety.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dartmoor Pony Society&lt;/a> and must adhere to certain breed standards including colour and must be &amp;ldquo;Bay, brown, black, grey, chestnut, roan. Piebalds, Skewbalds and Spotted are not allowed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shetland Ponies: A common choice. Once prized for use in the many mines of Devon and Cornwall, these incredibly strong and hardy ponies adapt well to Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s harsh conditions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dartmoor Hill Ponies: This is a loose term to describe ponies that are not registered with the DPS but are similar in shape. They can be any colour - Skewbald, Piebald, Spotty and all variations are common.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Others. From time to time, owners will graze other equines. These can be horses of any shape, and the commons framework allows for Donkeys, although I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen one grazing loose.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dartmoorcommonerscouncil.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dartmoor Commoners Council&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://dartmoorponysociety.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dartmoor Pony Society&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="dunnabridge-pound">Dunnabridge Pound
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>We&amp;rsquo;ve now nearing the famous Dunnabridge Pound&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dunnabridge Pound is one example of a pound where livestock was rounded-up so that owners could reclaim their animals before a time limit. &amp;ldquo;Illegal&amp;rdquo; animals were impounded and fines levied where the owner could be found. These were animals over the numerical limits for the size of a farm, they were only allowed to keep the number of animals that the farm could support over the winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unclaimed animals were sold off to the highest bidder. One can imagine that if the fine were too large, the owner might stay quiet and buy their &amp;ldquo;illegal&amp;rdquo; animal back at the end, at the risk of being outbid for it.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One might be forgiven that this rather grand structure was built for this purpose, but the probable truth is that it was actually the Judge&amp;rsquo;s chair for the Tinner&amp;rsquo;s council and was taken from nearby Crockern Tor where the Stannary Parliament met. If that is true, then it truly is a Judge&amp;rsquo;s chair, as sentence was passed at Crockern Tor for anyone who broke the very strict Stannary Laws.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This walk takes us up along a ridge taking in several tors, including one that was very important for the old Tin Mining Stannary laws. Then it drops into the West Dart River, exploring some Bronze Age Hut Circles and then back past Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood and down the valley back to the start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please note: In accordance with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/enjoy-dartmoor/places/wistmans-wood" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dartmoor National Park&amp;rsquo;s guidance&lt;/a>, please do not enter Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood itself, or disturb it in any way.&lt;/strong>
Sadly, due to huge numbers of visitors over recent years, significant damage has been caused even by those simply walking through it as well as those removing moss, branches or littering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If you just want to visit Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood, you can follow the path up from the given parking coordinates. This shortens the walk to about a mile each way and is a pleasant easy walk, although not accessible to wheelchairs. &lt;a class="link" href="#wistmans-wood" >Jump to Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This place is known as &amp;ldquo;Two Bridges Tor&amp;rdquo; as there is a distinct granite formation at the back which helps show how Tors on Dartmoor were formed, even when the Tor is underground. Rain water, being slightly acidic, soaks into the ground and rots the rock, primarily at cracks and weaknesses to form horizontal and vertical joints. Over a long period of time, the harder rock is left behind as the rest is changed into growan (Decomposed granite) and sand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We see this here as this quarry was dug to provide sand and gravel for road building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once exposed to the atmosphere, then weathering continues the early work of underground decay with with, rain and the freeze/thaw action of the winter to further attack the rock.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There seems to be a well repeated rumour that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from several people who are insistent that Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Tors were once volcanos. Sadly, this is completely untrue!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This imposing rock was chosen as the meeting place of Great Court of Devon Tinners dating from around at least 1300AD and possibly as far back as 1100. The court would meet here and establish tin laws, mete out punishments for breaches, pay taxes and distribute earnings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was also an impressive Chair made of slabs of granite with a tall back and overhang placed here by a granite table for court proceedings. The chair was moved to Dunnabridge Pound by a Mr Leaman using &amp;ldquo;12 yoke of oxen&amp;rdquo; - a team of 24 beasts - and it can be seen there today, just a few miles away.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Stannary&amp;rdquo; comes from the latin name for tin, Stannum. It also gives it its periodic definition, &amp;lsquo;Sn&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Down to the West and North of this tor is a very long rabbit bury (marked on the OS maps as &amp;ldquo;pillow mound&amp;rdquo;) that is part of Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Warren and is 108 metres long. There are over 30 mounds comprising the warre in this area, some barely noticable in the tussocky grass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sadly, these mounds they don&amp;rsquo;t photograph well, and just appear as lumpy brown areas.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pillow Mounds are man made rabbit warrens dating from at least the medieval period.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Their name comes from the pillow shape of the mounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>They were used to breed rabbits (Also known as Conies) for meat and fur. Rabbit was a mainstay of the local tin miners and was sometimes the only meat they would regularly eat.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Rabbit farming like this was done throughout Britain, and you can find many references to &amp;ldquo;Warren&amp;rdquo; in place names that persist today.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Altogether a remarkable place, said by early antiquaries to be the home of the druids, supposing Wistman to be a corruption of “wise man”. But, quite aside from the reality that there is no evidence whatsoever to associate these white-bearded priests with Dartmoor, this supposed derivation of the name is incorrect. There are two more plausible explanations for the name, either that it is derived from Welshman’s Wood, “Welsh” or “Wealas” being the Saxon word for “foreigners”, or that it comes from the Devon word “wisht” meaning “haunted”. &amp;ndash;&lt;cite>Mike Brown (2001), Guide to Dartmoor&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;li>The Trees are mostly Pendunculate (or English) Oak &lt;em>Quercus Robur&lt;/em> and known to be hundreds of years old, and some Rowan &lt;em>Sorbus Aucuparia&lt;/em> mixed in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shaped by the climate, weather and ground conditions almost unique to this location, they have naturally grown dwarfed.&lt;/li>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pub changed its name to Two Bridges Hotel some time prior to 1849, so pre-dates the modern road bridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saracen&amp;rsquo;s Head Inn: a booklet to mark its 225-year history records that &amp;ldquo;By 1772 the Turnpike bridge had been constructed across the Dart at Two Bridges and by 1794 Francis Buller had constructed the inn near the site. The inn bore the name of &lt;strong>The Saracen&amp;rsquo;s Head&lt;/strong>, a familiar name for pubs at the time but likely also connected to the fact that the Buller family crest was a Saracen&amp;rsquo;s head &amp;lsquo;affronte, couped, proper&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. Source: Alex Mettler (2015, rev.edn. 2018), Air Like Champagne: A short history of the Two Bridges Hotel, Dartmoor. Published by Two Bridges Hotel..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name &amp;ldquo;Two Bridges Hotel&amp;rdquo; seems to first appear after a change of landlord in May 1849 in an advertisement in the Western Morning News. In 1885, the name The Saracen&amp;rsquo;s Head Inn appeared in an advetisement to let including &amp;ldquo;that well known Inn House &amp;lsquo;The Saracen&amp;rsquo;s Head&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip;.. with buildings, stables, sheds and appurtenanes etc&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. The Two Bridges Inn was destroyed by fire in late May 1866, as reported in the Exeter Flying Post. The old name continued to be used for some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wentworth Buller, who cut the tree in 1868, was no doubt related to Sir Francis Buller, who had built the inn by 1794, some 74 years earlier? &lt;a class="link" href="https://boveytraceyhistory.org.uk/people/buller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>A web page about The Bullers of Bovey Tracy&lt;/a> mentions Capt. Thomas Wentworth Buller (1792-1852); Wentworth William Buller (1834-1883). There is &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Francis_Buller,_1st_Baronet#Moorland_improver" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>a Wikipedia entry for Sir Francis Buller&lt;/a> that includes &amp;ldquo;He also built an inn, named the Saracen&amp;rsquo;s Head after the Buller family&amp;rsquo;s crest, at Two Bridges, on a site now occupied by the Two Bridges Hotel.&amp;rdquo; This was citing: William Crossing (1902), A Hundred Years on Dartmoor, 5th edn, The Western Morning News Co.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warning: DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS WALK IN THE WINTER OR AFTER HEAVY RAIN&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This route includes crossing the Foxtor Mire. It can be dangerous even in summer, and care must be taken. There is also a river crossing of the Swincombe. Again, during winter, this can be surprisingly steep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You can avoid the crossing the mire by walking around the Western edge of the Mire and rejoin us at Goldsmith&amp;rsquo;s Cross - it adds about a mile to this walk but should be accessible in all weathers&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Few areas on Dartmoor include such a deep amount of historical, farming, religious, mining and legend as the Whiteworks area of Dartmoor. This walk takes us past mineshafts and directly across Foxtor Mire to the Goldsmith&amp;rsquo;s cross, then along to Childe&amp;rsquo;s Tomb - a burial site with a legendary tale. Then a walk up Foxtor itself, around to the ruined remains of Foxtor Farm, visits some Bronze Age Cairns, crosses a river and passes the hut circles of an ancient village on our return.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Whiteworks was one of Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s largest Tin mines, and possibly the longest active with records indicating work as early as 1180.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The name &amp;ldquo;Whiteworks&amp;rdquo; comes from kaolin, the white clay that lies in this natural bowl, formed from degraded granite. Cassiterite - Tin Ore - was found within the clay, and working it coated everything and everyone white.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The vast majority of visible remains of buildings and shafts are from the 19th Century when this was a very industrialised area. A Google Maps satellite view shows long lines of open cast pits, which were dug down by hand to expose a seam of ore. Later, as the easier pickings were used up, shafts and mines were dug&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mining activity gradually declined and finally ceased at Whiteworks in 1914, when the remaining men were drafted for the First World War. As with many mines on Dartmoor and throughout Britain at that time, they never reopened.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The distinction between &amp;ldquo;Mire&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Bog&amp;rdquo; is that bogs are fed by rainfall, and mires are fed by groundwater springs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The exact depth of the mire is disputed. There are stories that the Army drove a tank into it and it disappeared never to be seen again! That&amp;rsquo;s probably just a story, but it is certainly deep enough to drown a person, and the author has personally poked a stick in at least six feet over large parts of it. It will also grow and ebb depending on recent rainfall like a large sponge. Although it&amp;rsquo;s fed by springs, it&amp;rsquo;s also fed by surface water and slows the passage of water down the Swincombe valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a railway sleeper laid across the river to aid crossing roughly in the centre of the mire and this is marked &amp;ldquo;FB&amp;rdquo; on Ordnance Survey Maps.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This cross is named after Lt. Goldsmith R.N. who rediscovered it in 1903, after it had been lost for many years. He found it when out on his favourite walk whilst on leave from serving on HMS Imperial, then moored at Plymouth. On stopping for lunch, he happened to notice a rectangular hole cut into the large boulder on which he was sitting. Further investigation amongst the heather revealed the head and then part of the shaft. He later returned and arranged the reconstruction as you see it today.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Although the exact origin and date of the cross is unknown, it is thought that the cross was used to guide travellers across the mire, and indeed it is approximately where the current path.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Childe was a wealthy Saxon lord who loved hunting. The legend says that one winter he became trapped by a violent snowstorm and was disoriented. He made the decision to kill and disembowel his horse and climbed inside the stomach cavity to take what shelter he could. However, this was insufficient and he was found frozen to death inside.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This girt is an artificial valley dug by men searching for tin, probably in the 1700s or 1800s. They would redirect water down from the top to help wash out the granular tin which would settle in temporary dams at the bottom. Tin being heavier than the mud and soil, it would form a layer once left to settle which could be dug out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sam Parr was a labourer who worked at the nearby Fox Tor Farm in the mid 1800s. He had a wife and two children who were baptised in Princetown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ruins have also been identified as a blowing house for turning tin ore into ingots - there are certainly many remains of tinworkings and several tinner&amp;rsquo;s huts nearby, and it&amp;rsquo;s possible that Sam turned it into a home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the inner face of a large flat slab in the southeast corner of the building is an inscription &amp;ldquo;IC 1753&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the early 1800s, there were efforts to &amp;ldquo;Improve&amp;rdquo; Dartmoor for agricultural purposes - led largely by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt who was responsible for much of Princetown&amp;rsquo;s growth. The farm was build with locally sourced granite, including some stone robbed from the nearby Childe&amp;rsquo;s Tomb.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The farm was only occupied for 50 years, with David Gray being recorded as the main occupant and farmer. It was a sheep farm, and others tried to turn a profit here through the nineteenth century. But conditions were harsh and the remote location ultimately led to it being abandoned.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dartmoor Preservation Association strongly opposed the proposed flooding of this valley. In 1970, a parliamentary committee ultimately decided against the scheme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1985, the DPA used funds from a bequest to acquire 50 acres of land to try and prevent a similar scheme in the future. These stones mark its boundary.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a pleasant walk up a historic valley with plenty to see along the way. I&amp;rsquo;ve included a possible detour if you wanted to extend the walk to include Swincombe Intake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much of this land is owned by Anton Coaker who lives at Sherberton Farm who farms the distinctive red Galloway cattle and Dartmoor ponies on this land.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Coaker&amp;rsquo;s dedication to breeding good quality Dartmoor Ponies is well known and is several generations long. I recall visiting his mother, Diane Coaker, at Sherberton farm to view some of her ponies with my own mother in the 1980s. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Anton himself is very well known as the author of several books, newspaper articles and is a very knowledgeable and erudite writer on Moorland and Hill Farming matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Start the walk by proceeding back 140 meters along the road you approached the parking along, then turn right at the end of the wall along a Bridlepath&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dartmoor has had many fine dry stone wall builders, but perhaps the most famous of all was John Bishop (1821-1892). He was one of the first to use the shaped and squared building method in his walls. He tightly fitted large blocks of granite in such a way that very little daylight could be seen through the wall. He helped enclose many of the newtakes on Dartmoor and would have been in strong demand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When asked how he lifted such heavy stones, John Bishop is alleged to have replied, “Aw, ‘tis surprisin’ what ee can do with a laiver or two.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of the walls in this area were built or repaired by Mr Bishop who lived close by - we&amp;rsquo;ll visit his house on this walk - and are of a visibly better quality than most earlier walls, which were mostly built from natural moorstone, using &amp;ldquo;trigs&amp;rdquo; of small stone to wedge them in place. But no matter how well a dry stone wall is made, it needs repairing often due to weather and especially animals and people climbing it and loosening stone, so other men will have been involved over the years in keeping these walls stockproof.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dolly Trebble was a particularly attractive girl who caught the eye of many men of Dartmoor in the 18th Century. Despite being married to William Trebble, she was courted by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt (1762-1833) - an important man who shaped much of Princetown and Dartmoor, and no less than George IV, the Prince Regent who visited here several times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She was written about by Sabine Baring Gould and Dolly was clearly a woman of some fame. Tim Sandles has an entertaining version of Dolly&amp;rsquo;s story on his Legendary Dartmoor site if you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>When ready, proceed down to join the moor road to the west and walk a short way to the bridge over the river Swincombe, where you have a choice&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="detour-to-swincombe-intake">Detour to Swincombe Intake
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Possible detour (An extra mile and a half)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you continue walking along this road to the west, after around 1.2km you&amp;rsquo;ll come to the Swincombe Intake. This is a small reservoir and unusual art-deco building that collects water which is piped to Venford Reservoir to help fill it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Swincombe Intake Reservoir was built between 1929 and 1933 by Paignton Urban District Council Waterworks Department. A particularly ugly building with the exception of an art deco motif over the modern door, as befitting its construction date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If you took this detour, head back to the same point at the Fairy bridge when you are ready to return&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-flooding-of-swincombe-valley">The flooding of Swincombe Valley
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This valley starts up at Peat Cott with the infamous Foxtor Mire at its head, which acts as a huge sponge providing a steady flow throughout even the driest of summers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was that which prompted a plan in the 1960s to flood this entire valley to provide another reservoir on Dartmoor, far larger than the modest intake that has stood there for a hundred years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not surprisingly, this caused a lot of opposition. Perhaps the most vocal opponent was Lady Sylvia Sayer who, with the Dartmoor Preservation Association, resisted this at every turn. You will by now have noticed that you&amp;rsquo;re not under several meters of water, so it should be no surprise to learn that in 1970, the opposers won and permission was refused. Planning was retried several times through the 70s and 80s until in 1985, the DPA used funds from a bequest to acquire 50 acres of this valley to protect it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ore from the adit would be smashed down small enough to fit into the top hole of this stone which sat above the base stone. The top stone was then rotated, possibly by pony or donkey or water power, to grind the ore just as grain is turned into wheat. The resulting fine sand was then smelted to form ingots.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once smelted and the impurities floated off, the near-pure tin was poured into a mould stone to form a 200lb ingot. This was a standard weight for transporting by pony off the moor.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The chemical symbol for Tin is &amp;ldquo;Sn&amp;rdquo; which stands for stannous or stannic. From this comes the Latin for Tin, Stannum. From that, comes Stannator (Stannary parliament), stannary laws, stannary towns etc.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Above the main Gobbett Mine workings was the main adit which followed the mineral seam.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the Swincombe Intake was built in the 1920s, the builders needed to run a pipe from there to the Venford Reservoir some 6 kilometers away. They opted to reuse and extend this adit to run that pipe through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tunnel continues through the hill in a straight line for 540 meters, emerging in a field 150m North West of The Forest Inn.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The shed we park by was originally built for the forestry workers, but now is used mostly for storage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fernworthy forest was first planted in 1921 by the Duchy of Cornwall. At that time there was a national shortage of timber following the First World War and much was needed quickly, leading to a nationwide conifer planting scheme.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The forest comprises mostly of Sitka Spruce with some Douglas Fir and Japanese Larch. All are well suited to the Dartmoor conditions and provide a change of habitat for much wildlife. There are also pockets of deciduous woodland, notably around the reservoir.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Reservoir was built 1936-1942 by Torquay Water Authority and was the last granite dam built on Dartmoor at a cost of £246,000 - twice the original tender. It covers 76 acres and holds 380 million gallons. It&amp;rsquo;s 63 feet deep and water is piped to Trenchford Reservoir.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Start our walk by walking about 350m back along the road you entered by, and turning right into the Woodland through a gateway&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Lowton Brook West Settlement was described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 2 - The North, 35.4 - Lowton Brook West, page 157.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are eleven huts in this area, with this one being the furthest north, and the largest at 9.1 metres diameter. They date from the Bronze age, approximately 3300 BC to 1200 BC. The climate of Dartmoor was much milder then and many small settlements remain from human occupation of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each Hut Circle is the site of what was probably a fairly typical Bronze Age Roundhouse, with walls of stone and a thatched roof. A central firepit will have provided cooking and heat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the stone has been robbed by successive moor men, who used it for other buildings or walling, leaving the heavier base stones.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The hut circles probably came long after the stone row was erected, and it&amp;rsquo;s thought that the builders respected the row. Certainly, they did not steal its stones to build their huts, which would have been convenient.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The stone row is described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 2 - Asacombe Hill stone rows. This double row is similar to its neighbour on Hurston Ridge, a kilometre to the east. It is possible that a third row was planned but never installed, because the rows do not align well with the centre of the cairn.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The name Widecombe is from &amp;ldquo;Withy or Willow Valley&amp;rdquo;, a Saxon name. Settlements and a wooden church were established here long before the Normans invaded in 1066 and in the Domesday Book (of 1086) includes the manors of Natsworthy and Dunstone in the Webburn valley. Granite longhouses began to appear in the 1100 &amp;amp; 1200s as the Village grew and got richer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The large Granite Village Sign depicts the Uncle Tom Cobley song in a carved inset at the top. This sign was designed by Lady Sylvia Sayer in the 1940s who was chair of the Dartmoor Preservation Association from 1851 to 1973.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Lady Sayer was still a tremendous force on Dartmoor into the late 1980s. Respected, and perhaps a little feared, by the staff at Dartmoor National Park Authority when I worked there &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>A rare gravestone memorial in Widecombe churchyard, with two names for the same person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Olive Katharine Parr was the author who used the pen name, Beatrice Chase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Olive Parr, 1874 – 1955, moved to nearby Venton in the early 1900s and there wrote many books including &amp;ldquo;Through a Dartmoor Window&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somewhat of a self-publicist, Olive gave herself the rather grand title of &amp;ldquo;My Lady of the Moor&amp;rdquo;, claims to have invented the Uncle Tom Cobley story, and said she started the tradition of leaving fresh flowers on the grave of Kitty Jay. However, her descriptions of Dartmoor Life during the early twentieth century are without doubt very important from a historical perspective, and her passion for Dartmoor was no lie. She was also involved in the First World War effort, creating the &amp;ldquo;Knights of the White Crusade&amp;rdquo; - a movement to encourage all servicemen to be &amp;ldquo;Pure and noble&amp;rdquo;. She also campaigned against Dartmoor being turned into a National Park, and against its use as a Military training ground. Clearly a lady of strong opinions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dominating the village is the medieval &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Saint_Pancras,_Widecombe-in-the-Moor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Church of St. Pancras&lt;/a> which dates from the late 1300, although there is a list of vicars which goes back to 1253 for the Village. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes called The Cathedral Of The Moor due to it being so imposing, and also as it&amp;rsquo;s the biggest Church on Dartmoor. The 120ft tower was added in the 1400 or early 1500&amp;rsquo;s through the benevolence of the tinners&amp;rsquo; Guild of St Pancras.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Named after a Roman boy, Pancratius, martyred under Emperor Diocletian in 304 AD.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>An impressive group of buildings stand huddled together in the small hamlet of Bonehill, the centrepiece of which is the imposing sixteenth century longhouse of Middle Bonehill with its fine porch bearing the inscription IS 1682 on the lintel. An early nineteenth century barn stands alongside, whilst a seventeenth century barn stands on the opposite side of the road. Lower Bonehill is another sixteenth century longhouse, in the middle of a group of five seventeenth and eighteenth century outbuildings. Higher Bonehill is a sixteenth or seventeenth century farmhouse, not of the longhouse design. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Mike Brown&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This walk talks you out and back along Dr Blackall&amp;rsquo;s Drive to Aish Tor. The views to the West are nice and there&amp;rsquo;s a little history along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The walk is mostly on a stone track. Although dry and firm, some of the stones are loose so care is needed. There&amp;rsquo;s a gradual descent on the way out, and a corresponding climb on the return.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="dr-blackall">Dr Blackall
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Dr Thomas Blackwell MD FRCP (1814 - 4th May 1899, aged 85) trained at St George&amp;rsquo;s Hospital, London, and had a practice in Mayfair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He was the youngest son of Dr John Blackall (1771-1860), the sixth son of Rev. Theophilus Blackall, who was a Prebendary (Honorary Canon) of Exeter Cathedral. John Blackall was an eminent physician who trained at St. Bartholomew&amp;rsquo;s Hospital, London, and then returned to Exeter in 1797, settling in Totnes in 1801. When he died in 1860, Thomas, his only surviving son inherited his estate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thomas bought the nearby Spitchwick Manor at Poundsgate in 1867. It seems that he never married but according to Censuses from 1861 onwards, there was always a &amp;ldquo;Visitor&amp;rdquo;, A Mrs Julia Tindall, and her daughter Caroline. It was Julia who inherited his estate when he died.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 1870/1880s, Thomas had the &amp;ldquo;Drive&amp;rdquo; constructed for his pleasure and for visiting guests to enjoy carriage rides driving southwards to enjoy the magnificent views down the River Dart valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(This is disputed by Hemery (1987, p.588) who reports that it was cut &amp;ldquo;a century or so ago&amp;rdquo; by Gerald Warren and his family for Dr Joseph Blackall, of Spitchwick Manor.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mel Tor is perhaps more accurately named &amp;ldquo;Mil Tor&amp;rdquo;, which is short for &amp;ldquo;Middle Tor&amp;rdquo; as it is twixt Sharp Tor and Hockinston Tor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Note the inverted &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rdquo; slot in the post where timber would have been slid in and dropped forming a solid rail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These slots are usually found five to a side, and form the basis of the &amp;ldquo;5 bar gate&amp;rdquo; phrase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Elsewhere they are called &amp;ldquo;Slip gates&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Stang Stoops&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Yatsteads&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Hinge and L&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Stand Pole Gateways&amp;rdquo; being a common form of simple, but secure, gate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a good &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_gate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Wikipedia Article&lt;/a> showing some fine examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were prone to damage at the ends of the rails and gradually fell out of use as iron became more available for hinges.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There used to be a custom that involved the rolling of wooden wagon wheels down the hill of Mil Tor to the River Dart on Midsummer Day, but it fell into disuse during WW2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The practice was revived for a time in the late 1950s but not for long. The idea was to roll them down the 600-foot hill but the rock-strewn nature of the ground stopped most of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, the rusting iron tyres lie around in the wood, some with trees now growing up through them. &lt;cite>Hemery p.589&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is metamorphic bedrock formed approximately 318 to 328 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period. Originally formed as sedimentary rocks in swamps, estuaries and deltas to form slates. Later altered by low-grade metamorphism i.e. heating during geologic processes such as the nearby intrusion of Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s molten magma (granite).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This cairn seems to sit on a raised circular hump of ground that might be an earlier cairn or kist, although this is unverified.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This may not be Aish Tor at all - the exact location seems disputed, and certainly indistinct. Not perhaps the most impressive of Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Tors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>We must now retrace our steps back to the car park&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Whilst it is tempting to walk the road back to the start to make this a circular walk, the road is narrow and traffic often heavy. It&amp;rsquo;s surely nicer to retrace our steps and admire the view from a different angle.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This walk starts near the famous Warren House Inn and descends into the Redwater valley, home to many ancient tin workings and four distinct tin mines which were combined in 1845. This was a major industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries employing hundreds of people, and many ruins and reminders remain. The main route is firm and easy going, with a gentle hill on the final climb back to the car park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: The track along the valley, although firm underfoot, is often very wet all year round. Sensible footwear recommended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do feel free to explore the area and leave our track - there are many points of interest, some of which we&amp;rsquo;ve marked on the map and all are worth exploring.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the parking, on a clear day, you can see three rock walled enclosures across the valley. Together with a fourth (see map, central), these are known as the &amp;ldquo;Four Aces&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Playing Cards&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Legend tells&amp;hellip;
Jan Reynolds was a tin miner from Widecombe who was more interested in drinking and gambling than in going to church on a Sunday. Finding himself short of money he made a deal with the Devil: in return for money to fund his gambling the Devil could have his soul if he was found asleep in church.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jan soon forgot the pact and one Sunday he fell asleep while playing cards in church. There was a sound of horses’ hooves outside, and a flash of lightning so fierce that it tore off the top of the church tower, then the Devil strode into the church and snatched up the terrified miner, carrying him up into the sky and across the moor. Jan had four aces in his hand and he dropped them in what is now known as the Aces Field.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>One can quite clearly see a diamond shape, but it taxes the imagination to see the shape of a Heart, a Club and a Spade in these fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reality of these enclosures is that they were either to keep rabbits in or rabbits out. The farm just over the hill to the Easy is Headland Warren Farm, which was known to breed rabbits which formed a large part of the miner&amp;rsquo;s diet. I&amp;rsquo;m unclear whether the rabbits were kept in these enclosures, or they were built for growing crops which needed protecting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Take the path Eastwards into the valley for about half a mile&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="vitifer-mine">Vitifer Mine

&lt;p>This area contains the remains of four distinct mines:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Vitifer (Prev: Vytifer) Mine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Birch Tor Mine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy Birch Tor Mine (AKA Headland Mine)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Golden Dagger Mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Vitifer and Birch Tor were separate mines originally, then combined, then separated, and then combined again. Naming of these two seems interchangeable, with both workings being known by both names.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A fireplace or boiler would have been placed at the far end of the flue, and the smoke run through it to the chimney, which released it high enough not to bother those at ground level.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This mine was named after a bronze dagger was found here from the early men who lived here four thousand years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dagger was taken to Plymouth Museum, and rumoured to have been destroyed during World War 2 bombing of that building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A replica dagger is owned by DNPA and can sometimes be seen at their information centres and displays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This area was mined for Tin from at least the fifteenth century via surface streaming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mines were dug to chase tin further underground from around the 1750s. Given the amount of surface water in this area, one imagines these were very wet mines and hard to keep dewatered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The underground workings ended in 1914 when many men were drafted for the First World War. Some surface working remained until 1939 when again, the needs of war took labour away from the moors.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A buddle is a simple structure to separate material out by its density.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fine sediment is introduced at the centre point by trough or pipe in suspension with water. As it flows towards the outer edge, heavier material is deposited first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some buddles are assisted by rotary brushes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once sufficient sediment has built up, it is shovelled out with the &amp;ldquo;headings&amp;rdquo; containing the more valuable minerals in the centre, and the less valuable or waste known as &amp;ldquo;tailings&amp;rdquo; towards the edge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one is known to have been fed by a slurry onto the cone by a small leat arrangement and swept by a waterwheel-driven &amp;ldquo;wood and rags sweeps&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>An interesting walk through part of the historic town of Princetown, then along a decent footpath past Devonport Leat and Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Hall in an area of mining. Then we walk along the Conchies Road and learn about this piece of World War One history before visiting an ancient burial cist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few short optional diversions to visit other cists along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princetown">Princetown
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Prince&amp;rsquo;s Town was built by Thomas Tyrwhitt (1762-1833) and named in honour of the Prince of Wales, to whom he was Private Secretary. Thomas also built roads across Dartmoor and many other features. He was one of the Georgian Improvers who wanted to turn the &amp;ldquo;wastes&amp;rdquo; of Dartmoor into a thriving place to live and work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tyrwhitt was MP for Okehampton (1796-1802), Portarlington (1802-1806) and Plymouth (1806-1812). He built Dartmoor Prison in 1809 for French prisoners taken in the Napoleonic wars and it was also used for Americans taken in the 1812 war. He also built the Plymouth &amp;amp; Dartmoor Railway, which was originally a horse-dawn tramway that was later converted by the Great Western Railway to steam.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>2024: The Duchy Hotel has been rented from the Duchy of Cornwall by Dartmoor National Park Authority since 1991 for a fixed rent of £100 as an information centre. In November this year it was announced that despite informing almost 50,000 visitors this year, it is to close in May 2025 due to a shortfall in funding. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/2024-12-04/closure-of-dartmoor-visitor-centre-will-be-a-disaster-for-local-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>Jonathan Stones tells me that he was told by &amp;lsquo;Sonny&amp;rsquo; Williams (an old farm hand) that he helped one Val Forder (sometime tenant of Sunnyside when a Duchy Farm) to transport the said gate from its original working position at Dousland. It&amp;rsquo;s second life here was as a &amp;lsquo;cattle crush&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="aerial-ropeway">Aerial Ropeway
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The ropeway bringing timber from from Brimpts Plantation, powered by an engine at Moorlands Farm, ended nearby but I am told nothing visible remains. Many will remember old photographs in the Plume of Feathers in James Langton&amp;rsquo;s time showing the ropeway in action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ropeway was essentially an overhead cable supported by large wooden pylons that allowed relatively easy transport of wood from Brimpts, some four miles distant. Imagine something similar to a modern a ski lift, with logs suspended instead of skiiers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Forest of Dartmoor 1840 Tithe Map showing a mine at bottom left in Plot 119 marked &amp;ldquo;Mine&amp;rdquo;, close to Bachelors Hall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is another structure in Plot 116, this being an un-named plot owned (also) by George Nicholson Esquire and leased to William Mitchell, as this appears to have a wheelpit and a stream as a water supply it can inferred that this is the smelting house (see following).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two lines drawn across the mine area. The left one (through &amp;ldquo;119&amp;rdquo;, coloured blue) was the original Bachelors Mine Leat that became the prison foul (an open sewer) and extended away from the mine. The thinner line (through the &amp;ldquo;9&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;119&amp;rdquo;) was its replacement, Blackabrook Leat.&lt;/p>

>Heritage Gateway page on Bachelors Hall Tin Mine&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at our &lt;a class="link" href="#map" >map&lt;/a> below, we&amp;rsquo;ve marked some points of interest here relating to the mine:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A series of small tin pits, possibly contemporary with the early open-cast working of the area.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three shafts: Footway, Engine and Ann&amp;rsquo;s shafts, running NNE-SSW along the main tin lode. All 3 are now collapsed and capped.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A whim, attached to Engine shaft about 11m in diameter within a bank 3.5m wide, 0.6m high with entrance in the WSW.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shallow adit, one of 3 adits known to have been associated with the mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two dressing floors with associated earthen platforms for buddles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two wheel pits associated with stamps and dressing floors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The main wheelpit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A pump-rod gulley from the main waterwheel up to Engine shaft.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The prison, or foul leat. Initially called the Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Hall Leat and only extending as far as the mine was once the only source of water. After being taken over for use by the prison, mainly for sewage disposal, it was extended south and discontinued from mine use. It is now defunct.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Blackbrook leat - its construction probably necessitated by the original leat being used for the prison. This is also defunct.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Small reservoirs associated with the treatment areas of the mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Areas of ridge and furrow cultivation, possibly contemporary with the mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Devonport, or Dock, Leat skirting the east side of the mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The building is generally accepted as the site of the corn mill and bakery (permission dated 1798 but built post-1809), later converted to a Naphtha Works; the ruin downstream is thought to be a smelting works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both documentary and map sources indicate the existence of other buildings at Bachelors Hall. Thomas Tyrwhitt built a late 18th century house here and a few years later he was granted a lease to build a corn mill; this suggests two separate buildings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tithe map and census returns both imply the existence of a farm at Bachelors Hall which if proved would have co-existed with mill cottages for the short duration of the Naphtha Works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A second 19th century Duchy map shows Bachelors Hall as an L-shape building slightly larger than it is today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A building depicted downstream is allegedly the smelting works, and two structures higher up the hillside to the west annotated `Brewery&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 1839 Tithe Map depicts a building here of L-shape with other buildings and the farm outbuildings more or less as they are today.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It may be that this is the original house built by Tyrwhitt in the late 1700s and the modern buildings are where there were cottages for mill, bakery or mine workers.&lt;/p>

>Heritage Gateway Page for this Smelting House&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A tin smelting house was in operation at &amp;lsquo;Bachelors Hall&amp;rsquo; near Princetown from 1798-1807. It was erected by T Gray in 1795.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Smelting is the process in which ingots of metal are won from the crushed ore by the process of heating until the metal is liquid - in this case Tin. The furnace is heated by whatever fuel is available - probably wood or charcoal here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the late 1790&amp;rsquo;s, John Swete described the smelting house as &amp;lsquo;on the banks of a small stream which emptied into Blackabrook&amp;rsquo; having stamping mills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Duchy of Cornwall records date from 1798-1804 that indicate 223 ingots were smelted in that period weighing 27.43 tonnes with a further 1.07 tonnes listed for 1807.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In sale particulars of 1828, the smelting house had been converted to a brewery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The site of the brewery is shown on the sale plan as being beside the west bank of the stream where agricultural buildings now stand. The photograph above shows the presumed wheelpit for the stamping mill and combines blowing house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using these figures: 27.43 tonnes (metric) = 60,346 lbs (UK) = 270 lbs/ingot = 2.4 cwt. That is 121 kg or two small adults. Poor pack ponies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The building of nearby Tor Royal by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt at Prince&amp;rsquo;s Town was completed in 1798 and through the first decade of the 1800&amp;rsquo;s there were experimental plantings of coniferous shelterbelts to protect it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Duchy of Cornwall established a plantation at Brimpts in 1862. Forestry grew after WW1 in an effort to replace the country&amp;rsquo;s greatly depleted timber stock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By 1930, plantations had been established at Fernworthy, Bellever, Brimpts, Bear Down, Soussons and Frenchbeer (Chagford) and in 1930 these areas were sold to the Forestry Commission (founded in 1919).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By 1938, the eastern slopes of Bellever Tor and Lakehead Hill were planted and the western slopes between 1940-1943. &lt;cite>Source: The New Forests of Dartmoor (1964), London HMSO, Forestry Commission booklet No. 10, pages 6-10.&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tree of choice for planting on Dartmoor is the Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis, chosen for its high productivity compared to e.g. Douglas fir, Norway spruce, European larch and other fast-growing conifers. (text from the walk on 25 February 2018).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bull Park farm was built by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt for a cattle-herdsman some time before 1833. Its enclosures were used to segregate bulls from cows and calves when not required for breeding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last tenant farmer quit on Christmas Day, 1957, and the property then became a holiday cottage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is now a private home and the owners told me that the old shed was the bull shed and still has rings in the wall for tying the bulls.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This starts the &amp;ldquo;Conchie Road&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the First World War, all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 41 were required to fight for their country. &lt;em>(Except for clergy, teachers and certain classes of industrial worker)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/yourcountry/overview/conscription/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Parliament article about the Conscription Law&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of those men, any who refused to fight for moral or other rules were labelled &amp;ldquo;Conscientious objectors&amp;rdquo;, or Conchies. They were not a well liked group of men, seen as cowards and abused and taunted by men and women alike.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As they would not fight or contribute to the war effort, they were treated as prisoners. Some were housed in Dartmoor Prison and as punishment for their &amp;ldquo;cowardice&amp;rdquo;, they were given hard labour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One particularly pointless form of this work was to build this road. It goes nowhere and serves no purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The work will have been hard and brutal. Stones taken both locally and from the Dartmoor Prison Quarry would have been hit repeatedly by sledgehammers until they were small enough to be packed into a solid base to form the road, again by packing with hammers or heavy tamps, and heavy man-powered rollers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see, there is little protection from the wind and driving wind up here. In winter especially, this would have been a truly miserable task.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re enjoying the walk, you may like to extend it by a mile or so by walking cross-moor North to Blakey Tor and back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is marked on the map as a dotted red line and takes in a pretty, rarely visited tor and another two ancient burial cists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Dartmoor contains an unusally high occurence of cists, or burial cairns. These are stone tombs dating back to the Bronze age, some four thousand years ago. We know of several hundred of these, and more are still being found, having been buried by the peat&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no definite record of why this cist was so called. People have speculated that a crock (jar) of gold was found here, perhaps buried with the body that was once here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or perhaps it was just wistful thinking, that grave robbers might find rich pickings? There are other Dartmoor similarly named - the Money Pit on Yar Tor is one such.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;em>Note from Simon: My mother once drove this road alone at night in the 1980s and swears she saw a coffin lying in her path. She swerved and avoided it, but didn&amp;rsquo;t dare return to investigate. I know of no other reports of coffins on this road but the incident was very close to the ancient Lich Way of which she wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware at the time.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="about-the-lich-way">About the Lich Way
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Lich Way is a 17 mile path across Dartmoor from beyond Bellever through to Lydford.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We join it on our way to the Powdermills for only a short distance, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting piece of Ancient Dartmoor history.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prior to 1260, residents of the farms and villages in this area of Dartmoor belonged to the Parish of Lydford. This meant that as well as travelling off the moor to attend services, they were expected to bury their dead in the consecrated ground of Lydford, then a major and powerful town. Coffins were carried by ox or pony cart, strapped directly onto pack ponies, or carried by men.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The route bears many memories of its purpose. There is a Coffin Wood, and many suitable large flat rocks along the route are identified as &amp;ldquo;Coffin Stones&amp;rdquo; where the heavy burden was laid so the carriers could rest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lich or Lych? Both methods of spelling are in wide usage, both on Dartmoor and elsewhere. The word is thought to be derived from the German &amp;ldquo;leich&amp;rdquo; or Dutch &amp;ldquo;lijk&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Corpse&amp;rdquo;, so perhaps Lich is the more correct.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="about-gunpowder">About Gunpowder
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Gunpowder is a mixture of three components of varying proportions depending on intended use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder#Composition_and_characteristics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>More info - Wikipedia&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the production of gunpowder is complicated and is unsurprisingly dangerous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Powdermills site is also complicated. Everything (except for the water) entered the site at the Southern entrance. Various stages in production occurred going up through the site to the three incorporation mills at the north end and then coming back down through the site until final storage in a main magazine ready for shipment to buyers.&lt;/p>

alt="This DNPA Notice on the first Incorporation Mill explains the process"
class="gallery-image"
data-flex-grow="177"
data-flex-basis="426px"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gunpowder, black powder or rock powder (local name) used for quarrying and mine blasting, is still used in fireworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The composition is 75% saltpetre, 15% charcoal and 10% sulphur (aka brimstone or burning stone).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dynamite, more powerful, was patented in May 1867 by Alfred Nobel. Its success as a superior explosive led to eventual closure of the mills in 1897.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ingredients, saltpetre (mostly from India), sulphur (mostly from the Vesuvius and Stromboli regions of Italy) and the charcoal (made from local wood, especially alder or alder buckthorn), were ground separately in a grinding mill house. These were then blended in the required proportions in large barrels tumbled by waterwheels. This incorporated them into a single compound using a combination of mixing, crushing and churning. This was a hazardous process that was governed by strict regulations and regular inspections. Only wooden and copper tools were allowed , so as to prevent sparks causing explosions. The men had to wear leather aprons and sof-soled shoes, no hobnail boots. There is a story that one man, Silas Sleep, who took his breakfast and dinner to eat at work, always ate them both together, in case he was &amp;lsquo;blowed up&amp;rsquo; and sent to meet his maker before lunch time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Incorporation&amp;rdquo; was the first stage of production, in one of the three incorporation mills (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) at the top of the site, it resulted in a form of &amp;ldquo;cake&amp;rdquo;. It was probably at this stage that the powders were dampened with water to reduce &amp;ldquo;dust&amp;rdquo; and prevent accidental explosions. This also helped the very soluble salpetre to mix into the porous charcoal. The resulting damp paste or &amp;ldquo;mill cake&amp;rdquo; was shaped into &amp;ldquo;corns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was &amp;ldquo;ripe charge&amp;rdquo; that could be stored for a short period. It was then pressed down in e.g. a 2-ft square box to &amp;ldquo;press cake&amp;rdquo; about an inch thick. Originally this was a hand-powered process, like a cider press, but later a water wheel was used to drive the presses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next stage was &amp;ldquo;corning&amp;rdquo; when slabs of cake were broken up with wooden mallets into a granular form. Later, water-powered machines were used. This involved rollers and then sieving through different sized meshes. The powder was then tumbled in rotating barrels or cylinders. These were covered with gauze to collect any small dust-sized particles. This was another water-wheel powered process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next stage was &amp;ldquo;glazing&amp;rdquo;, where the grains were tumbled again, with graphite or black lead to give each grain of powder a waterproof coating. This made the powder suitabe for use in damp mines and quarrying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last stage was &amp;ldquo;drying&amp;rdquo;, sometimes in the open air. Usually, this was done in heated &amp;ldquo;Gloom stoves&amp;rdquo;. These were heated by an iron furnace with the powder laid on trays stacked around it. Later, steam stoves were used to heat pipes near the trays. The process used a flue to take away any sparks and fumes to a chimney - and this is seen at the south, bottom end of the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final product was packed in large oak barrels that were covered with leather to prevent spillage and from stray sparks entering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The gunpowder quality was tested periodically using the proving mortar that lies beside the road going into the Powdermills site. The strength was determined by firing a 68 lb iron ball over a distance that was then measured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the actual gunpowder makers or millers, the Powdermills employed coopers, blacksmiths, carpenters, wagoneers, carters, wheelwrights, stable staff and labourers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-powdermills-history">The Powdermills History
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>George Frean&lt;/strong>, a Plymouth Alderman, founded the Plymouth &amp;amp; Dartmoor Gunpowder Company and opened Powdermills in 1844; it closed in 1897. It had employed about 100 men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>George Frean later teamed up with James Peek, one of three brothers importing tea - wanted a biscuit business for &amp;ldquo;tea and biscuits&amp;rdquo; - wrote to George Frean, &amp;ldquo;miller and ships biscuit maker&amp;rdquo;, who had married a niece of theirs, to manage &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peek_Freans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Peak Freans&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole complex was powered by water which was brought in by three leats. Initially, one leat came from the east bank of the Cherry Brook to a rectangular reservoir north of the three isolated incorporating mills. The water then returned to the Cherry Brook. The second leat came from the west side of the Cherry Brook to a circular reservoir behind the buildings. Water was taken for four years without Duchy permission. Permission was quickly granted because the Prince Consort, Prince Albert, had encouraged the venture. Later, water was also leated from the East Dart River to the north end reservoir. The water was then leated to water wheels used for grinding and powering other machinery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The leat through the site is described in the book Industrial Archaeology of Dartmoor as now being dry and &amp;ldquo;two points at which it crosses the Cherry Brook, which flows between the buildings, can be seen. At one of these points, after feeding half the wheelhouses, the leat passes under the Cherry Brook through a wooden launder, which is still in place, in hard and excellent condition in spite of its years of saturation. Further downstream the leat&amp;rsquo;s channel back under the brook is of stone, big enough for a man to enter. The water had to be conveyed some way before being allowed to discharge, in order to prevent pollution of the Cherry Brook&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Waterwheels were used in the three massively-built incorporating mills (1,2,3 on the &lt;a class="link" href="map.jpg" >map&lt;/a>), glazing mill (4), pressing house (5) and two in the incorporating/composition mill and cartridge pressing house/corning/dusting house and glazing mill complex (6,7), and the final preparation rooms (8), making eight altogether. There is also a ninth, disused wheelpit at the final preparation rooms with later lean-tos in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Separate from the powder works to the south, along the road in, is the row of 19th century buildings that included cottages, a manager&amp;rsquo;s house, school, cooperage and a small Methodist chapel. Today, there is a pottery, offices and farm buildings. South of the cottages beside the road is the proving mortar and nearby is a wheel-binding stone, used for fixing hot iron rims to cart and wagon wheels.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There can be confusion identifying buildings when referring to the 2019 book and the 1990 survey listed above. The book starts at the south end of the site (page 98) with &amp;ldquo;Building 1&amp;rdquo; and the archaeogical survey starts from the north. The survey numbers are in (brackets).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no known map saying what each building was used for, so there is conjecture based on the gunpowder-making processes and the requirements for them to be carried out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If ready-made charcoal was brought in, then the South Chimney could have been for processing saltpetre, dissolving it and recrystallising it to make it more pure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three phases of development and extension have been identified and it is likely that the function of the buildings changed over time. A flue and chimney indicate heat was involved. The flue to the chimney is about 1 metre deep and 1 metre wide. Its eastern portion is now open and rubble-filled, but the western portion is still capped. It enters the base of the chimney which is set on a plinth. The chimney is about 10.5 metres high.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Long rectangular single-storey building located at the southern end of the site and aligned north to south.. Two, possibly three, phases have been identified. Water was culverted through the building under the floor. Its north wall was probably the dwarf wall which now subdivides it from the extension to the north. Dwarf walls in one interior consist of one long spine wall and two side walls. Another dwarf wall runs east to west across the structure from the northernmost door to the east wall. These appear to form a raised floor with water, air or heat circulating beneath. A small, square, stone-lined feature to the west of the south-west corner may be a well, or possibly a pit in which staves were soaked. The building is described in the book as the Watch House, where materials in and out of the site were monitored. It might also have been used as a store.&lt;/p>

Consists of two pairs of structures on either side of two wheelpits. The tailrace of the southern wheepit discharges back to the Cherrybrook. The wheel between the southern mill was powered by a continuation of the leat powering buildings to the north. The wheelpit tailrace discharged via a channel into Cherry Brook. The culvert has an arched roof of granite blocks overlain by slabs.&lt;/p>

The three incorporating mill houses (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) were of massive construction with many granite blocks being 6-feet long and the was about 6-feet thick, to withstand inadvertent explosions. The roofs were very flimsy, of wood and tar, to blow off without damaging the main structure. They could be replaced easily.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background: 5 (1) Incorporating Mill:&lt;/strong> Consists of a pair of gable-ended structures flanking a large central wheelpit. Both of massive granite blocks with walls about 2 metres thick at their bases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tar dribbles indicate original roofing was of tarred tarpaulin or wood. This was probably to allow any accidental explosion to go upwards and leave the walls standing, a technique still used by artisinal powder makers in India and China today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wheelpit is aligned north-east to south-west and runs the whole width of the units. Wheel axle appears to have projected into their ground floors. Powered by a launder to the north-east which flowed out through a culvert to the south-west. This is roofed for 3.5 - 4 metres, then becomes an open channel which runs downhill to feed the reservoir belonging to &amp;lsquo;Building 2&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The raised bank at the left brought the leat that fed a launder to the waterwheel.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This proving mortar is just off the road, on the left, on the last bend when driving in approaching the Pottery, cafe and mill cottages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It fired a (probably) 68 lb ball to test the powder. The distance travelled by the ball was a measure of the strength of the powder and undoubtedly a good sales tactic for potential buyers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This walk was reached from a small roadside layby marked by the yellow cross below the &amp;ldquo;Lich Way Plaque&amp;rdquo; label on the map. Normally, for a group, it would be reached from the main car park in Postbridge or the car park in the forest just across the road from it. There is also a car park at Higher Cherry Brook Bridge, marked with the P symbol and yellow cross on the map&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Please note that there is no parking available at the Powdermills Pottery and shop except when visiting them&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
