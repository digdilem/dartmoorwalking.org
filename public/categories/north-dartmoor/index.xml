&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This walks takes us up the Northwestern slopes to Sourton Tors, stopping to view the Iceworks on the way. After admiring the views from the Tor, we make a short detour to visit the Applecrusher before following the gradient around the Western face of the tor and back to the car park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Leave the car park and head Southwards upwards along the paths&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dartmoor reaves are ancient long, straight lines of stone or earth that were built during the Bronze Age, primarily between 1500 and 1200 BC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exact purpose of the reaves remains somewhat debated, but they are believed to have served a variety of functions, such as Boundary Markers, Agricultural features to contain livestock or for ceremonial or ritual practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dartmoor has the most extensive and well preserved systems of prehistoric field boundaries in Europe.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This system of earthworks and ruined buildings hints at one of the attempts to bend Dartmoor to man&amp;rsquo;s will. It can be viewed as a Folly, for it was not successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These works date from 1875 when a Mr James Henderson leased the land from the Duchy of Cornwall for a period of 15 years and he was allowed to &amp;ldquo;form ponds, and collect, and store ice for a term of 21 years running from February 1875 at an annual rent of £10.&amp;rdquo; He spent several thousand pounds setting up this endeavour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ponds were not allowed to be deeper than three feet and must be securely fenced. It was an agreement that upon completion, that the land be returned to its natural state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plan was simple enough - to fill ponds with water and wait for winter to freeze them. Then ice would be cut and transported to Plymouth for sale, at up to £3 a ton.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, events worked against Mr Henderson. A series of unusually mild winters meant little or no ice was produced, and then a rival company set up in Plymouth that created ice all year around, and that dropped the price to just £1 a ton, with none of the transport costs associated with hauling it there. Although this spelled the ending for these Iceworks, the Plymouth Rival also went out of business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The scheme collapsed and a meeting was called with the Duchy in 1886 to surrender the lease early. Mr Henderson had tried to sell the Iceworks as a going concern for a little as £100 - a huge loss on his investment - but there were no takers and it remained unsold. As you can see, the land was never returned to its natural state so remains as a monument to risky business plans.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This hole appears to be a core sample, taken by unknown persons. It&amp;rsquo;s not a drill mark, nor a tare and feather hole. Nor is it a rock worm, as suggested by some wags.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To a non-expert, this rock seems to be sedimentary, then changed by heat into a metamorphic rock. Perhaps it is unusual and that&amp;rsquo;s why it was sampled?&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This style of crush had a horse, pony, donkey or ox walking around with a rigid wooden bar mounted to its harness. This was connected through the middle of a heavy, round stone or hardwood wheel that ran in the groove and onto the central pivot. As the wheel turned, apples would be thrown into the groove and mashed. There would be a run-off channel for the juice, which was collected to turn into Cider. As you can imagine, this created a lot of juice and would have needed several people to operate efficiently, giving an indication of scale and how important Cider was to Devonians.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This specific example was either broken when being carved, or during transport. Or it was intended to be made in two halves to make it easier to carry. It&amp;rsquo;s not known where the other half is.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Belstone is one of the prettiest villages on Dartmoor and retains a strong farming link. The large lawn slopes away down to an ancient ford and often has Dartmoor Ponies and sheep grazing. This was once a mining village, with the valley between Belstone and Sticklepath hugely industrialised, although it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see traces of that now.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once present in most villages, stocks were used to shame and punish transgressors - often for crimes against the church. The victim was secured in place so that anyone passing could taunt them, or throw rotten fruit at them - I&amp;rsquo;m sure many old grudges were settled here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stocks themselves have been replaced many times, and it&amp;rsquo;s reported that a blow up doll was punished here for the village&amp;rsquo;s Millenium celebrations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This celtic cross has moved around. Believed carved between the 7th and 9th centuries AD, William Crossing writes that it was rediscovered at this chapel when some stairs were taken down in 1861. It was then taken to a nearby rectory and built into a wall. It was returned here in 1920 when the Old Rectory was abandoned&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here were once nine young ladies who dared to dance on the Sabbath and were so turned to stone. A single stone apart from the others was the piper who played a tune for them, and he was similarly treated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently, if you visit at noon or when the Belstone church bells ring, you can see the stones swaying gently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This stone circle was originally a burial mound or kistvaen covered in earth. The grave was robbed many years ago, and the mound of earth to the Southwest was likely what was dug off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As known as: The Dancing Stones. The Seventeen Brothers. The Nine Stones.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The staining on the ground by metalliferous leaching indicates that there are metal ores in this vicinity. This particular mine was dug for Tin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adits are horizontal tunnels used in mining. Some are used for access in and out and some are used for draining upper levels of water. This one is only open for about 10 meters, and was worked in tandem with the shafts on the slope immediately above it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There would have been a spoil heap here when they were dug, but that has been removed by later activity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is one of two wheelpits found here and is the earliest, showing on the 1841 Tithe Map. A large waterwheel once ran here and was to drive a series of flat-rods back and forth motion which carried the power to the nearby quarry where it powered pumps to keep the water free of water, which at its end reached a depth of 130 feet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a second wheelpit just upstream but it is known that both were not used together. They ceased operation by 1905.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wheels were fed by a reservoir above and a wooden launder (a basic 3-sided chute to run water down) and were of &amp;ldquo;pitch back&amp;rdquo; design, where water was added to the top of the wheel so that it filled buckets and drove the wheel back towards the wooden launder that supplied water. It was found that one reservoir didn&amp;rsquo;t supply enough water as the needs of the quarry grew and a second was added to increase flow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Meldon Viaduct was built in 1874 by William Galbraith from wrought iron for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to connect Okehampton to Lydford and then on to Plymouth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was widened to double-track in 1879 by building a second viaduct alongside, this one of steel, and joining the two. This was in service until 1968 when it became yet another victim of the Beeching Cuts. Meldon Quarry continued to use it up until the 1980s for shunting its trains until the track was removed in 1990.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s now used by &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Granite_Way" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Granite Way&lt;/a> - a shared-use foot, cycle and bridlepath and is a scheduled monument.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These are some of the quarry&amp;rsquo;s waste dumps, more properly named as &amp;ldquo;finger dumps&amp;rdquo; for their shape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the late 1800s the &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo; was taken in trucks to a series of corrugated iron buildings at the northern end of the east side tramway. A transfer shed was used where the finished material was consigned to wagons operating on an incline leading to the London and South Western Rail sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct. This incline becomes apparent as an earthwork partially obscuring the mouth of the early lime kiln. The crushed stone was used as ballast on railways and roads across the country and any unsuitable stone ended up here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This old limestone quarry, now flooded. It was used to dig a special Carbonifereous period limestone, not found anywhere else on Dartmoor, and much prized for producing lime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pool is about 130 feet deep, and when worked was kept drained by pumps driven by the water wheels earlier on our walk. This makes it deeper than the viaduct is high, that being a mere 120 foot tall at its highest span.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hundred years ago this site will have been very noisy and busy, with explosions and cranes operating, horse drawn carts rumbling around and men shouting. There will also have been rock crushers and stamps running within earshot, as well as steam trains going over the railway.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The carts of finished stone were weighed here before leaving for the railway. The design would have been similar to modern weighbridges and these metal grids formed the top layer of weighing scales that were read from within the weigh house. The quarry will have recorded its output using these figures, and from that set prices charged and paid.&lt;/p>

data-flex-grow="177"
data-flex-basis="426px"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lime kiln was built between 1880 and 1885.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lime was made in the kiln by setting alternating layers of limestone and charcoal made from coppiced hazel trees. Once the kiln was filled to the brim, the fire was lit and everything burned at a high temperature for three days, leaving behind quicklime, Calcium Oxide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slaked lime can be made, carefully, from lime by adding water. This process is called hydration and as the reaction is exothermic, a huge amount of heat is produced and this can be extremely dangerous. Quicklime was so named from the old word &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo;, as it acted like it was alive when water was added as it churned and boiled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once made, quick and slaked lime have many uses:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Agriculture&lt;/strong>: Increases the PH level of fields by being spread in powder form, transforming acidic soils into sweeter and more productive ground.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Construction&lt;/strong>: Lime Mortar has long been used for building, and is favoured even today for stone buildings instead of cement mortars, as it can move and even heal small cracks as it absorbs moisture. It&amp;rsquo;s also used as limewash for painting, and lime render to cover and stabilise walls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Manufacturing&lt;/strong>: Lime is used for all sorts of things, including paper, steel, sugar, paint and other processes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Medicine&lt;/strong>: In the right conditions, lime is also a disinfectant, and is used in purification methods.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Somewhere near to the turbine house there were once corrugated iron buildings that housed crushers. These worked previous spoil heaps, crushing limestone which was then loaded onto wagons on an incline that led to the railway sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This stone ruin was once where explosives for the quarry were kept. Before each shift, the explosives handler would take only enough from here for that shift&amp;rsquo;s operation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such handlers were often selected from the most careful and thorough of the workers, and would avoid carrying any iron tools, or even removed iron hobnails from their boots to reduce the chance of sparks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although the walls are strong, explosives stores often had very weak roofs - typically made of stick and oilcloth. If there was an accident, then the force would be sent upwards instead of outwards and repairs to the building would therefore be relatively quick.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are mine shafts on the east bank of the river with two adits nearby, typical of tin mining. They exist as sub-circular hollows with rims of upcast soil on their downslope margins. They vary in diameter, most examples being in the area of 3 metres with one exceptional example of 6 metres.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These modern buildings are associated with more recent quarrying after 1921. The site remained open for a further fifty years until around 1970 and provided stone for road metalling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before these buildings, there was a failed glass bottle operation on this site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the late 19th century, investigations were being made concerning the production of granulite (a granular metamorphic rock) at Meldon. There seemed to be potential to establish both glass and china works at the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was little activity until 1920 when a syndicate from London decided to build a glass factory. Two furnaces were installed out of a planned 12, and about 500 men were required. However, by February 1921, the men had been laid off and new owners were being sought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No obvious features remain of a glass industry, but large amounts of broken glass fragments can be seen, mostly representing small medicine and cosmetic bottles. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; (Western Morning News 29/03/1920&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Meldon Dam was begun in 1970 and completed in 1974, making it the newest of Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s large dams.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is 55 meters (180 feet) high.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s 200 meters (660 feet) wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The reservoir is stocked with Brown Trout for licenced angling.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uniquely, Meldon reservoir became the first water-supply body to produce electricity when a 500kW turbine generator was installed in 1987 to produce electricity to work the pumps and treatment works.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This spillway appears to be a combination of a straight chute and stepped spillway features. These are designed to reduce the kinetic energy of overflowing water and thereby reduce erosion damage. This system is essentially an uncontrolled system in that there are no mechanical gates or vanes to regulate the rate of overflow at the top of the dam.&lt;/p>
