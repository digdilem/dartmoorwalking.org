Most people seem to overlook Haytor Down in their eagerness to get into other parts of the moor but there is much to appreciate here, from stunning views over Teignmouth\u0026rsquo;s coastline, to an abandoned quarry, the stover granite tramway and a lovely stretch of ancient woodland.\nThis walk can be done in either direction, but anti-clockwise is advised, as you can then appreciate the views full as you walk down the Granite Tramway.\nGeocaching Geocaching is a game of finding hidden containers using a GPS or Smart Phone. The containers have a small paper log which you sign to prove you were there, and a website where you log your find. Basic membership is free. If this sounds a lot like Letterboxing, that\u0026rsquo;s because it is based on it, but brought up to date. Many Dartmoor walkers and Letterboxers also geocache as they go hand in hand, and Geocaches are a good way to find interesting places to explore.\nThere is a series of Geocaches that follow this walk (that\u0026rsquo;s why I know this area, I set these caches and walk this route to maintain them once or twice a year!) If that sounds interesting, pop over to the first cache page of the series\nStarting the walk Leave the car park and walk down the road to where the granite tramway crosses it, some 300 meters. Turn left and follow the tramway East.\nHaytor Granite Tramway We follow this old tramway for about a mile downhill\nThis tramway was built on the instruction of George Templer (1781-1843), a family that also built the main Haytor Quarries, the Stover Canal and Stover House in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The gauge of this tramway is 4'3\u0026quot; and it\u0026rsquo;s taken from granite cut and shaped at the Haytor quarries. There are sets of points further up the tramway where the trams could be steered into different quarries or sidings. Granite cut from Haytor or Holwell Quarries was loaded onto strong wooden trucks (See picture below) The Tramway runs down from Haytor Rocks to Stover Canal, where the granite would be transferred to sailing barges to take it to Teignmouth docks. Around 12 of these trucks were connected together in a \u0026ldquo;train\u0026rdquo; with the iron wheels sitting in the flat sections. A team of around 18 horses was then connected in single file to one end of the train. If it was loaded and heading downhill, the horses would be fixed to the last truck to provide braking. If they were pulling the trucks back up from Stover, they would be hitched to the front to better pull. The tramway is intact for much of its original course, down through Yarner Woods, past Bovey and on to Stover. This Haytor Tramway wagon is kept at the DNPA Head Office at Parke, Bovey Tracey.\nOn a clear day, the views along this section look over South Devon towards the gap in the land where the Teign Estuary reaches the sea at Teignmouth.\nWhen we reach a cross roads with a wooden signpost, leave the Tramway (Templer Way) and turn left, slightly uphill\nHaytor Down Quarry Much less known than its larger brothers closer to the Tor. There is some corrugated iron just to the right where a shed or small building once stood.\nWoodland Walk We walk gently upwards along this bridlepath for almost a mile, enjoying the many fine and unusual trees\nThe Haytor Down Adits The sound of running water will alert you to this large collector tank above the path - it always seems to be overflowing even in the driest summer, and runs across the path here.\nThe water is fed into this tank from a blue alkathene pipe, which continues up the hill over loose waste rock. If you follow it, it actually enters a gated Adit which is always dripping and provides a clearly sufficient flow.\nThere are actually two adits here, about a hundred meters apart on the same level, both with small fences and gates, and usually padlocked.\nThese adits don\u0026rsquo;t go far in, and side trials are short. The waste rock outside has a red tinge which indicates iron, so it\u0026rsquo;s likely that\u0026rsquo;s what was being searched for.\nThe actual adit area is quite overgrown now, but worth a detour if you like adits and don\u0026rsquo;t mind a bit of a scramble through undergrowth.\nThe sight of this cable box always seems at odd with the timeless, even primeval nature of these woods.\nYarner House You may spot some rooftops downhill as you\u0026rsquo;re walking along. These belong to Yarner House. This is a Grade II Listed Tudor house dating back to the 1600s and has been renovated to a luxurious standard.\nThe Yarner House estate is 247 acres. It was part of the Manor of Bovey Tracey which William the Conqueror (Norman invader of 1066, also known as William the Bastard) siezed and then granted to Geoffrey de Mowbray, Bishop of Coutances. On de Mowbray’s death in 1093, his nephew, Robert Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, inherited, but later defied the king, which led to the seizure of his estates in 1095. Eventually, ownership of the Bovey Tracey estates reverted to the Crown until, in the 16th century, a succession of costly wars left Tudor monarchs strapped for cash. Elizabeth I began to sell off Crown properties and, in 1578, the Yarner estate was bought by Gregory Sprint, a canny lawyer with good Court connections, who swiftly resold it at a profit. The estate includes Yarner Woods, which is managed by Natural England and has several miles of woodland paths open to the public. There are copper mines in Yarner woods which, combined with other mines and quarries contributed to the wealth of the estate. Today, it is a Hotel that offers Bed \u0026amp; Breakfast.\nTripadvisor entry for Yarner House Countrylife article for Yarner House On clear days, the view over this hedge is most pleasing, taking in Bovey Tracey and the hills behind.\nAs we approach the road, curve left and join it back up the hill to the parking\nParking This walk starts at the blue parking on this map, but sometimes that can get busy. If so, alternative parking is shown by red stars on the map.\nThere are toilets and an Information Centre at the nearby Haytor Lower Car Park.\n","date":"2024-12-29T14:18:32Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/haytor-down/map_hu15021418631985462930.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/haytor-down/","title":"Haytor Down"},{"content":"Information Distance: 3 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words good.highlighted.supple Map Introduction This walks takes us up the Northwestern slopes to Sourton Tors, stopping to view the Iceworks on the way. After admiring the views from the Tor, we make a short detour to visit the Applecrusher before following the gradient around the Western face of the tor and back to the car park.\nLeave the car park and head Southwards upwards along the paths\nDartmoor reaves are ancient long, straight lines of stone or earth that were built during the Bronze Age, primarily between 1500 and 1200 BC.\nThe exact purpose of the reaves remains somewhat debated, but they are believed to have served a variety of functions, such as Boundary Markers, Agricultural features to contain livestock or for ceremonial or ritual practices.\nDartmoor has the most extensive and well preserved systems of prehistoric field boundaries in Europe.\nWikipedia - Reave Iceworks This system of earthworks and ruined buildings hints at one of the attempts to bend Dartmoor to man\u0026rsquo;s will. It can be viewed as a Folly, for it was not successful.\nThese works date from 1875 when a Mr James Henderson leased the land from the Duchy of Cornwall for a period of 15 years and he was allowed to \u0026ldquo;form ponds, and collect, and store ice for a term of 21 years running from February 1875 at an annual rent of £10.\u0026rdquo; He spent several thousand pounds setting up this endeavour.\nThe ponds were not allowed to be deeper than three feet and must be securely fenced. It was an agreement that upon completion, that the land be returned to its natural state.\nThe plan was simple enough - to fill ponds with water and wait for winter to freeze them. Then ice would be cut and transported to Plymouth for sale, at up to £3 a ton.\nUnfortunately, events worked against Mr Henderson. A series of unusually mild winters meant little or no ice was produced, and then a rival company set up in Plymouth that created ice all year around, and that dropped the price to just £1 a ton, with none of the transport costs associated with hauling it there. Although this spelled the ending for these Iceworks, the Plymouth Rival also went out of business.\nThe scheme collapsed and a meeting was called with the Duchy in 1886 to surrender the lease early. Mr Henderson had tried to sell the Iceworks as a going concern for a little as £100 - a huge loss on his investment - but there were no takers and it remained unsold. As you can see, the land was never returned to its natural state so remains as a monument to risky business plans.\nLegendary Dartmoor - Iceworks This hole appears to be a core sample, taken by unknown persons. It\u0026rsquo;s not a drill mark, nor a tare and feather hole. Nor is it a rock worm, as suggested by some wags.\nTo a non-expert, this rock seems to be sedimentary, then changed by heat into a metamorphic rock. Perhaps it is unusual and that\u0026rsquo;s why it was sampled?\nDNPA Meldon Geology Case Study (PDF) When ready, walk upwards towards the tor\nSourton Tors When done admiring the views, head Southeast around 375m towards the junction of several paths at a small pond\nApplecrusher This style of crush had a horse, pony, donkey or ox walking around with a rigid wooden bar mounted to its harness. This was connected through the middle of a heavy, round stone or hardwood wheel that ran in the groove and onto the central pivot. As the wheel turned, apples would be thrown into the groove and mashed. There would be a run-off channel for the juice, which was collected to turn into Cider. As you can imagine, this created a lot of juice and would have needed several people to operate efficiently, giving an indication of scale and how important Cider was to Devonians.\nThis specific example was either broken when being carved, or during transport. Or it was intended to be made in two halves to make it easier to carry. It\u0026rsquo;s not known where the other half is.\nBoundary Stone We now head down the track to the Southwest, bearing right after a hundred meters or so, aiming just left of the Sourton Tors outcroppings\nAmerican Influence American Soldiers trained in this area when preparing for D-Day in 1945. Although hard to distinguish, the above feature was a former World War II Machine Gun Nest. Fortunately never needed on Dartmoor, but a sobering reminder of the many lives were lost across the Channel.\nKeep following the gradient below the Western side of Sourton Tors and then head back to the parking\nParking Turn off at the main A386 Tavistock to Okehampton road, passing between the embankments of the old railway - now the Granite Way.

Its history is interesting and worth a visit. There are often a very nice heard of Dartmoor ponies grazing around Wind Tor and Southern Hamel Down. (Please keep your distance and definitely do not feed)\nTwo Crosses Stone In the bank opposite the starting car park is this modern stone, dating from 2008. The former gatepost was donated by a Mr R Whale and was carved by the Dartmoor National Park Authority using their stonemason, Andy Cribbett. When completed, a ceremony was held on the 10th of July 2008 and the stone placed.\nBut why?\nThis location is the point where the manors of Jordon, Blackslade, Dunstone and Widecombe town intersect. Always known as ‘Two Crosses in the Turf’ this location was always marked by two crosses cut into the turf, every year the village lengthsman would re-cut them to ensure of their visibility. \u0026ndash; Legendary Dartmoor - Two Crosses\nFollow the path behind the stone towards Wind Tor\nLeft to right: Honeybag Tor (Elevation 445m/1459 feet). Chinkwell Tor (456m/1496 feet). Bell Tor (354m, 1161 feet)\nWind Tor When I was about 12 years old in the mid 1980s, I stayed for a short time at the nearby Rowden Adventure Centre. We walked up here and we were shown the first Letterbox which was hidden under these rocks, which helped spark a lifelong interest in finding tupperware in crevices \u0026ndash; Simon\nLegend says that this row of holes are the footprints left by a fox that the Devil transformed as he chased it across the moor\u0026hellip;\nOr drill holes for splitting the rock by tare and feathers, you decide.\nWhen you are ready, continue walking due South towards the wall corner below. Although the map mentions Hut Circles at this point, there is sadly little to be seen today. We then join the open moor road and follow it to the junction where we turn right towards Drywell\nDrywell Cross This was probably one a gate hanger stone, where the upright of the gate was cupped at the top to allow swinging before iron hinges were readily available.\nThis stone was once a waymarker to Widecombe Church and was restored in 1967 by Dartmoor Preservation Association. The replacement shaft matches the cross head in that all limbs are octagonal.\nDartmoor-Crosses - Drywells Cross Turn right at the cross and head North toward Dockwell\nDockwell Dockwell dates back to at least the Medieval period and has several traditional Dartmoor stone buildings.\nShortly past Dockwell, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a signpost pointing off the road to Hutholes. We follow that path, returning here afterwards\nHutholes Hutholes was a settlement of six buildings dating back to the Saxon period. It was certainly occupied at the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066 and seized by the invading French.\nDaily routine revolved around farming, growing crops, animal husbandry and household chores.\nAbandoned some time in the 14th century, it lay largely forgotten until 1963 when the local farmer, Mr Hermon French, talked about it to a Mrs Minter, who organised an archaeological dig,\nWe use the house numbers as given on the board.\nHouse 3, believed to be occupied up to the 12th century. This was probably original Depdona Manor house. The name was later changed to Dewdon and once this site was abandoned, was relocated half a mile away and renamed again, this time to Jordan.\nIn the Domesday Book (1066 AD), Depdona was owned by a wealthy Englishman called Alric. By 1086 it had been relinquished to one of the conquerors, William de la Falaise \u0026ndash; (Butler, Vol. 1 page 142)\nLegendary Dartmoor - Hutholes Once you have explored Hutholes, follow the path back to the road and turn left, then straight across the next crossroads\nParking There is roadside parking at the top of Wind Hill.

A medium walk through quiet woodland with some climbs on mostly firm forestry tracks.\nThe shed we park by was originally built for the forestry workers, but now is used mostly for storage. Fernworthy forest was first planted in 1921 by the Duchy of Cornwall. At that time there was a national shortage of timber following the First World War and much was needed quickly, leading to a nationwide conifer planting scheme. The forest comprises mostly of Sitka Spruce with some Douglas Fir and Japanese Larch. All are well suited to the Dartmoor conditions and provide a change of habitat for much wildlife. There are also pockets of deciduous woodland, notably around the reservoir. The Reservoir was built 1936-1942 by Torquay Water Authority and was the last granite dam built on Dartmoor at a cost of £246,000 - twice the original tender. It covers 76 acres and holds 380 million gallons. It\u0026rsquo;s 63 feet deep and water is piped to Trenchford Reservoir. Start our walk by walking about 350m back along the road you entered by, and turning right into the Woodland through a gateway\nLowton Brook West Settlement The Lowton Brook West Settlement was described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 2 - The North, 35.4 - Lowton Brook West, page 157.\nThere are eleven huts in this area, with this one being the furthest north, and the largest at 9.1 metres diameter. They date from the Bronze age, approximately 3300 BC to 1200 BC. The climate of Dartmoor was much milder then and many small settlements remain from human occupation of the time.\nEach Hut Circle is the site of what was probably a fairly typical Bronze Age Roundhouse, with walls of stone and a thatched roof. A central firepit will have provided cooking and heat.\nMost of the stone has been robbed by successive moor men, who used it for other buildings or walling, leaving the heavier base stones.\nThis gatepost was cut much later than the hut circles, likely in the medieval period or even later.\nFollow the track to the Southeast above Lowton brook, and take a sharp right up a steep hill\nTurn Left here and follow the track up the spine of the ridge, beating right after about 300 meters\nAssycombe Double Stone Row 125 meters long Faces North Westerly and oriented East Northeast to West Southwest. Restored in the 1890s There\u0026rsquo;s a menhir at the top end and a blocking stone at the bottom. Includes 133 medium and large sized stones. Originally there were 11 more stones, including a second blocking stone. J Butler notes that the row is very similar to the Hurston Ridge Double Stone Row, only 1km away. The hut circles probably came long after the stone row was erected, and it\u0026rsquo;s thought that the builders respected the row. Certainly, they did not steal its stones to build their huts, which would have been convenient.\nThe stone row is described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 2 - Asacombe Hill stone rows. This double row is similar to its neighbour on Hurston Ridge, a kilometre to the east. It is possible that a third row was planned but never installed, because the rows do not align well with the centre of the cairn.\nFollow the track down to Assycombe Farm\nAssycombe Farm Assycombe (Also Asacombe) Farm is the ruin of a deserted Medieval and Post-Medieval farmstead. There are two rectangular buildings with a field.\nA shard of pottery recovered from this site has been positively dated to 13th-14th Century The Longhouse to the South is the oldest of the two buildings.

This is to allow animals to leave the richer farm grazing and venture forth onto the moor.\nHeritage Gateway MDV52653 - Corn ditch within Trowlesworthy Warren, Shaugh Prior Outhome Cist Cuckoo Rock The name is said to come from this being the place where a local farmer always heard the first cuckoo, although one can also believe that it looks like a cuckoo\u0026rsquo;s egg in a nest of small eggs.\nIt was once a tradition for young boys to climb this rock, which is a bit of a struggle.\nShaft Just to the right of this and behind the wall, is a mine shaft that\u0026rsquo;s marked \u0026ldquo;Shaft\u0026rdquo; on the map.\nAdit Tip: To find this adit, cross the second stile going north from the corner of the forest. A path leads down to the left, look for running water draining from the adit. It is a few yards from the stile. Then return here and progress West\nPCWW Boundary Stone These boundary stones mark the point where rainfall will end up in the Burrator Reservoir.

The large lawn slopes away down to an ancient ford and often has Dartmoor Ponies and sheep grazing. This was once a mining village, with the valley between Belstone and Sticklepath hugely industrialised, although it\u0026rsquo;s hard to see traces of that now.\nBelstone Stocks Once present in most villages, stocks were used to shame and punish transgressors - often for crimes against the church. The victim was secured in place so that anyone passing could taunt them, or throw rotten fruit at them - I\u0026rsquo;m sure many old grudges were settled here.\nThe stocks themselves have been replaced many times, and it\u0026rsquo;s reported that a blow up doll was punished here for the village\u0026rsquo;s Millenium celebrations.\nLegendary Dartmoor - Belstone Stocks\nMemorial Stone GRV 22.VI 1911 GRV = George Rex V King George V - Coronation 22 June 1911 E II R 1952 2002 Commemorating 50 years reign of Queen Elizabeth II who acceded to the throne on the death of King George VI on 6 Feb 1952\nThe Pound Zion Chapel and Telegraph Office The sign above the door says \u0026ldquo;Telegraph Office\u0026rdquo; and there is a more modern telephone box outside, also an old Post Collection Box in the wall.\nBefore it was a Telegraph Office (1937-1979) this building was a Zion Methodist Chapel (1840-1841) and Sunday School. (1856-1899)\nHeritage Gateway MDV109484 - Zion Chapel, Belstone St Mary the Virgin Church A church was first built here in 1260.\nIncised Celtic Cross This celtic cross has moved around. Believed carved between the 7th and 9th centuries AD, William Crossing writes that it was rediscovered at this chapel when some stairs were taken down in 1861. It was then taken to a nearby rectory and built into a wall. It was returned here in 1920 when the Old Rectory was abandoned\nDartmoor Crosses - Belstone Incised Cross For our walk, we leave the village now by taking the road to the Northwest, before turning left into a path and then out onto the moor at Old Rectory Farm - the site where the above cross spent some time\nBelstone Cleave Rocks We turn back south now, but follow the contour path due Southwards around the enclosures\nWatchett Hill Cottage Watchet Hill Cottage, also known as Black Hut or Black House, was built around 1800 and last occupied in the mid 1960s before falling into disrepair.\nNotably, the author Eden Philpotts stayed here before making the house of the main locations in his famous novel, The Secret Woman.\n\u0026ldquo;The mean dwelling house of Watchet Hill faced north.

This particular mine was dug for Tin.\nAdits are horizontal tunnels used in mining. Some are used for access in and out and some are used for draining upper levels of water. This one is only open for about 10 meters, and was worked in tandem with the shafts on the slope immediately above it.\nThere would have been a spoil heap here when they were dug, but that has been removed by later activity.\nHeritage Gateway MDV120318 - Adit west of the West Okement River at Meldon Quarry Heritage Gateway MDV120320 - Mine shafts west of the West Okement River at Meldon Quarry Wheelpits This is one of two wheelpits found here and is the earliest, showing on the 1841 Tithe Map. A large waterwheel once ran here and was to drive a series of flat-rods back and forth motion which carried the power to the nearby quarry where it powered pumps to keep the water free of water, which at its end reached a depth of 130 feet.\nThere is a second wheelpit just upstream but it is known that both were not used together. They ceased operation by 1905.\nThe wheels were fed by a reservoir above and a wooden launder (a basic 3-sided chute to run water down) and were of \u0026ldquo;pitch back\u0026rdquo; design, where water was added to the top of the wheel so that it filled buckets and drove the wheel back towards the wooden launder that supplied water. It was found that one reservoir didn\u0026rsquo;t supply enough water as the needs of the quarry grew and a second was added to increase flow.\nHeritage Gateway\tMDV20471 - Northern wheel pit at Meldon Quarry This second wheelpit housed a water wheel some 18 foot in diameter. The walls are better preserved than the first but quite overgrown. Behind it, there is a depression which is a \u0026ldquo;bob-pit\u0026rdquo;. This housed a large counter-weight which kept tension on the flat-rods as they worked to operate the quarry pumps.\nMeldon Viaduct The Meldon Viaduct was built in 1874 by William Galbraith from wrought iron for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to connect Okehampton to Lydford and then on to Plymouth.\nIt was widened to double-track in 1879 by building a second viaduct alongside, this one of steel, and joining the two. This was in service until 1968 when it became yet another victim of the Beeching Cuts. Meldon Quarry continued to use it up until the 1980s for shunting its trains until the track was removed in 1990.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now used by The Granite Way - a shared-use foot, cycle and bridlepath and is a scheduled monument.\nWikipedia - Meldon Viaduct Waste Dumps These are some of the quarry\u0026rsquo;s waste dumps, more properly named as \u0026ldquo;finger dumps\u0026rdquo; for their shape.\nIn the late 1800s the \u0026ldquo;waste\u0026rdquo; was taken in trucks to a series of corrugated iron buildings at the northern end of the east side tramway. A transfer shed was used where the finished material was consigned to wagons operating on an incline leading to the London and South Western Rail sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct. This incline becomes apparent as an earthwork partially obscuring the mouth of the early lime kiln. The crushed stone was used as ballast on railways and roads across the country and any unsuitable stone ended up here.\nHeritage Gateway MDV120325 - Tramway routes at Meldon Limestone Quarry Meldon Pool This old limestone quarry, now flooded. It was used to dig a special Carbonifereous period limestone, not found anywhere else on Dartmoor, and much prized for producing lime.\nThe pool is about 130 feet deep, and when worked was kept drained by pumps driven by the water wheels earlier on our walk. This makes it deeper than the viaduct is high, that being a mere 120 foot tall at its highest span.\nA hundred years ago this site will have been very noisy and busy, with explosions and cranes operating, horse drawn carts rumbling around and men shouting. There will also have been rock crushers and stamps running within earshot, as well as steam trains going over the railway.\nHeritage Gateway MDV4826 - Meldon Lime Works The limestone quarry was smaller in 1841 with various buildings around it that disappeared as the quarry became larger. Beyond the buildings, an inclined plane can be seen extending northwards to take stone to the kiln.\nWeigh House The Weigh House was ruined, but during 2019 was being rebuilt.\nHeritage Gateway MDV120246 - Weigh House and weighbridge south of the Meldon Viaduct The carts of finished stone were weighed here before leaving for the railway. The design would have been similar to modern weighbridges and these metal grids formed the top layer of weighing scales that were read from within the weigh house. The quarry will have recorded its output using these figures, and from that set prices charged and paid.\nGrace\u0026rsquo;s Guide to British Industrial History - Barlett \u0026amp; Son Lime Kiln This lime kiln was built between 1880 and 1885.\nLime was made in the kiln by setting alternating layers of limestone and charcoal made from coppiced hazel trees. Once the kiln was filled to the brim, the fire was lit and everything burned at a high temperature for three days, leaving behind quicklime, Calcium Oxide.\nSlaked lime can be made, carefully, from lime by adding water. This process is called hydration and as the reaction is exothermic, a huge amount of heat is produced and this can be extremely dangerous. Quicklime was so named from the old word \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;alive\u0026rdquo;, as it acted like it was alive when water was added as it churned and boiled.\nOnce made, quick and slaked lime have many uses:\nAgriculture: Increases the PH level of fields by being spread in powder form, transforming acidic soils into sweeter and more productive ground. Construction: Lime Mortar has long been used for building, and is favoured even today for stone buildings instead of cement mortars, as it can move and even heal small cracks as it absorbs moisture. It\u0026rsquo;s also used as limewash for painting, and lime render to cover and stabilise walls. Manufacturing: Lime is used for all sorts of things, including paper, steel, sugar, paint and other processes. Medicine: In the right conditions, lime is also a disinfectant, and is used in purification methods. Under the viaduct The Railway was extended as a single track as far as Lydford in 1874 and this involved building the viaduct, spanning the river for 165 metres.\nThrough this gate and to the left is an early lime kiln.\nTo the right is a bank that supported a tramway to the gate for bringing out old waste from the finger dumps, and down ahead is the Turbine House.\nThe possible crushing house feature (seen below) is just out of sight on the right in this image\nThis is the earlier kiln, built before an Okehampton Estate map of 1790 and originally serving a small nearby quarry. It became disused but was used again when the Meldon Pool quarry started up.\nThis is earliest building in the valley to exploit the local geology. The view is partially blocked by an inclined tramway that took quarried stone up to the railway viaduct, which was built in 1874.\nHeritage Gateway MDV120326 - Site of crushing sheds at Meldon Limestone Quarry This wall may be part of the crushing house where waste was brought from the finger dumps to be crushed and taken past the kiln by tramway up to sidings for use as ballast on the railways, but this is not certain as little is recorded about it.\nTurbine House Water was piped from the Red-a-ven brook to a turbine housed in this building, generating power for the quarry. Spent water was then released into a short brick-lined channel on the West side of the building to return to the brook.\nDevon \u0026amp; Dartmoor HER - MDV120311 - Turbine building at Meldon Quarries My guess from this base and similar designs is that this was a horizontal turbine with a pelton wheel with one or more jets coming in from the side to power them. A central shaft would then have transferred power into a generator mounted directly above it \u0026ndash;Simon\nSomewhere near to the turbine house there were once corrugated iron buildings that housed crushers. These worked previous spoil heaps, crushing limestone which was then loaded onto wagons on an incline that led to the railway sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct.\nExplosives Magazine This stone ruin was once where explosives for the quarry were kept. Before each shift, the explosives handler would take only enough from here for that shift\u0026rsquo;s operation.\nSuch handlers were often selected from the most careful and thorough of the workers, and would avoid carrying any iron tools, or even removed iron hobnails from their boots to reduce the chance of sparks.\nAlthough the walls are strong, explosives stores often had very weak roofs - typically made of stick and oilcloth. If there was an accident, then the force would be sent upwards instead of outwards and repairs to the building would therefore be relatively quick.\nThis ground anchor looks very similar to those used through the 20th century to secure straining wires for telegraph and electricity poles. It was probably employed for a similar purpose here.\nMineshaft There are mine shafts on the east bank of the river with two adits nearby, typical of tin mining. They exist as sub-circular hollows with rims of upcast soil on their downslope margins. They vary in diameter, most examples being in the area of 3 metres with one exceptional example of 6 metres.\nDevon \u0026amp; Dartmoor HER - MDV120322 - Mine shafts east of Meldon Pool This pit is part of a old tin-working gert running down towards the river. The gert ends at SX 56589 92163 where a spoil heap starts and ends closer to the river at SX 56562 92171, quite high above the surrounding ground.\nThe Bottle Factory These modern buildings are associated with more recent quarrying after 1921. The site remained open for a further fifty years until around 1970 and provided stone for road metalling.\nBefore these buildings, there was a failed glass bottle operation on this site.\nFrom the late 19th century, investigations were being made concerning the production of granulite (a granular metamorphic rock) at Meldon. There seemed to be potential to establish both glass and china works at the site.\nThere was little activity until 1920 when a syndicate from London decided to build a glass factory. Two furnaces were installed out of a planned 12, and about 500 men were required. However, by February 1921, the men had been laid off and new owners were being sought.\nNo obvious features remain of a glass industry, but large amounts of broken glass fragments can be seen, mostly representing small medicine and cosmetic bottles. \u0026ndash; (Western Morning News 29/03/1920\nSouth Quarry Here we can see the darker aplite disappearing into the ground, with the less desired striped chirt, similar to that at Meldon Pool.\nMeldon Dam Meldon Dam was begun in 1970 and completed in 1974, making it the newest of Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s large dams.\nIt is 55 meters (180 feet) high.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s 200 meters (660 feet) wide.\nThe reservoir is stocked with Brown Trout for licenced angling.\nUniquely, Meldon reservoir became the first water-supply body to produce electricity when a 500kW turbine generator was installed in 1987 to produce electricity to work the pumps and treatment works.\nWikipedia - Meldon Dam\nAt each end of the dam are these structures. They are used to check the dam\u0026rsquo;s alignment and curvature to ensure there is no movement.\nThis spillway appears to be a combination of a straight chute and stepped spillway features. These are designed to reduce the kinetic energy of overflowing water and thereby reduce erosion damage. This system is essentially an uncontrolled system in that there are no mechanical gates or vanes to regulate the rate of overflow at the top of the dam.\nMany of these plaques on Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s reservoirs were made of bronze and have been stolen in recent years for their scrap value. Hopefully this one does not appear to the thieves.\nOnce across the dam, we are back at the car park and our walk is complete\nParking Parking is at the Meldon Reservoir site, which is Pay and Display.

However, her descriptions of Dartmoor Life during the early twentieth century are without doubt very important from a historical perspective, and her passion for Dartmoor was no lie. She was also involved in the First World War effort, creating the \u0026ldquo;Knights of the White Crusade\u0026rdquo; - a movement to encourage all servicemen to be \u0026ldquo;Pure and noble\u0026rdquo;. She also campaigned against Dartmoor being turned into a National Park, and against its use as a Military training ground. Clearly a lady of strong opinions.\nBeatrice Chase - Wikipedia Widecombe Church Dominating the village is the medieval Church of St. Pancras which dates from the late 1300, although there is a list of vicars which goes back to 1253 for the Village. It\u0026rsquo;s sometimes called The Cathedral Of The Moor due to it being so imposing, and also as it\u0026rsquo;s the biggest Church on Dartmoor. The 120ft tower was added in the 1400 or early 1500\u0026rsquo;s through the benevolence of the tinners\u0026rsquo; Guild of St Pancras.\nNamed after a Roman boy, Pancratius, martyred under Emperor Diocletian in 304 AD.\nThe church was badly damaged in the Great Thunderstorm of 1638, apparently struck by ball lightning.

The abandoned quarries have been retaken by nature despite having been worked as recently as 1966. The quarries once supported an entire village of based here at Foggintor, with a School, Chapel and 30 cottages. The landscape will have looked very differently here two hundred years ago at the height of its industry. Now only evocative ruins remain.\nThe Mission Hall Across the road from the parking area are the ruins of the old non-denominational Mission Hall, built in 1887 and demolished in 1965.\nDue to problems at Foggintor school, the Mission Hall opened as a school on 17th August 1896 to house 41 pupils and soon that grew to 95 children. The school closed on 27th September 1912 and the children went to temporary schools at Merrivale and back to Foggintor Chapel until the new school opened at what is now known as Four Winds, on 19th April 1915.\nIn the photograph above, Great Mis Tor is seen at top right.\nDartmoor Explorations has some photographs of how the mission hall looked We start our walk by following the track away from the road to the South\nRed Cottages This leat still supplies Yellowmeade and formerly ran on to supply Foggintor. It is probable that the cottages were supplied by a bullseye stone to regulate water use.\nThe cottages stood on the high ground on the left of the photograph (but to the right of the track) and were separated from their gardens by a back lane. The cottages were planned in 1846 and built by April 1849. They were probably demolished in 1953, the same year as Hill Cottages.\nAccording to various Censuses, they were originally known as Mount Pleasant Cottages, then West View Cottages, and after that, Red Cottages.\nThey were built with cob and by 1871 the weather got into them so badly they were \u0026ldquo;covered with corrugated iron\u0026rdquo; and painted with red lead, thus becoming known as Red Cottages - this appears in the 1871 Census.\nKath Brewer writes in \u0026ldquo;The Railways, Quarries and Cottages of Foggintor\u0026rdquo; that in later years they were actually black, having been covered with pitch, again against the weather.\nThere were six cottages but with twelve dwellings - with \u0026ldquo;one up, one down\u0026rdquo;. In the 1861 Census, there were thirteen families with 50 adults and 38 children at West View, as the cottages were known at that time.\nLarge weighted iron bars were used to drill the granite to take the explosive charge. These drills, known as Jumpers, were tested here to ensure they were sharp enough.\nYellowmeade The \u0026ldquo;lumps and bumps\u0026rdquo; in the background are waste tips of Foggintor Quarry.\nYellowmeade Farm itself was not established until 1860, the last farm to be founded in Walkhampton Parish. It was enclosed by George Cole whose family lived there until about 2015.\nFurther on we\u0026rsquo;ll see clear evidence of worked trackway blocks, proving this track was also once a horse-drawn railway.\nSett Making A quarryman once stood at this point making Setts.\nSetts are granite blocks that were much used for paving roads and paths, and can still be seen in many cities, for they last a very long time.\nRough cut setts blocks be brought here, such as cut from the Cake Stone above. To cut down on transport, the bankers typically set up very close by to the raw material, and their workplaces - bankers - were rough and ready; somewhere to stand and work the stone at around waist level.\nIn exposed conditions, and this certainly qualifies, they would erect shelters to keep off the rain, snow and the worst of the wind. These would have been made of oilskin tarpaulin with a stick framework, probably on three sides, backed to the wind.\nThe tools were iron chisels and a hammer, with the working stone set on a bed on firm earth and granite chips, which would absorb the blows.\nIt was a hard job. As well as the obvious difficulties of weather and repetitive, physical work; the sett-maker\u0026rsquo;s hearing will have suffered and worse, many will have suffered from silicosis from working granite and died early from lung problems.\nThe stone here is the waste rock - where setts failed, often through cracks in the rock or where edges were trimmed off.\nTraditional stonemasons still work very similarly to this, but now have tungsten tipped chisels and, when working with granite, a full-face respirator system.\nWhen I worked for DNPA in the late 1980s, they often employed a traditional stonemason who would work just inside the entrance of the Works Depot in Bovey Tracey. He had a 45 gallon oil drum full of granite chips on which he\u0026rsquo;d place his work, which might be a perfectly spherical ball to sit atop a gatepost. He\u0026rsquo;d stand there all day, chipping away. Pausing every now and then to offer up a hardboard template to check his progress, or check diameter with a set of large calipers. He wore a full face respirator, with a battery pack and inlet on his belt at the back, similar to those used by industrial welders, which blew filtered air into the mask. \u0026ndash; Simon\nFoggintor Quarry The \u0026ldquo;bumps\u0026rdquo; on the left skyline are high-level waste tips while the enormous waste tip to the right is named \u0026ldquo;Big Tip\u0026rdquo;.\nRoyal Oak Quarry (later known as Foggintor) was worked from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, extracting granite that was taken away on the nearby railway line. This track was a horse-driven rail or tramway, so some deliveries will also have left this way to the road, as well as bringing supplies into the quarry and its accompanying village.\nRemains on the site include ruins of numerous buildings, large spoil tips and tracks, including that leading to the nearby Swell Tor Quarry, was closely associated. Foggintor was known to have included up to 30 cottages, a large Manager\u0026rsquo;s house, smithy, powder house, dressing sheds and stables.\nThe Quarry was first dug in 1820, then known as Royal Oak Quarry. Through the 1830s through 1840s, up to 600 men were employed by the local quarries, some living at Foggintor and most journeying in each day. In the 1861 Census, 267 people were registered as living at Foggintor. As well as Foggintor, Hill Quarry and Royal Oak Quarry, this was also known as Foggator - probably a local dialect corruption. The Houses of Parliament and Nelson\u0026rsquo;s Column were built from granite taken from this quarry. More locally, stone from here was used to build Tor Royal at Princetown, and likely some other Princetown buildings, although the Prison\u0026rsquo;s stone was mostly dug from the nearer Herne Hole Quarry. Foggintor Quarry was owned at one time by the Johnson Brothers who also took the lease on Haytor Quarry, but closed it and then sold stone from Foggintor Quarry under Haytor\u0026rsquo;s name. The quarry closed in 1966, putting 40 men out of work. One factor given was competition from cheaper sources abroad, and an increasing use of concrete instead of stone in architecture. The stones that form Big Tip are huge, especially on the lower levels. Approaching from the side you can see some must weigh many tons, and cracks in between are big enough to easily conceal an adult. This looks like it might have once been a kistvaen or cist, but could also be a split or worked stone from the sett-makers or even a natural feature.\nThe blocked up gateway above is in the angle at the right of this photo.\nHill Farm Hill Farm, also known as Eva\u0026rsquo;s Farm. The family was at Foggintor on the 1881, 1891 and was still present until at least 1936.\nMethodist Chapel and School Ruins These scant foundations were once a schoolhouse and a Wesleyan Chapel.\nThe quarry workers originally sent their children to the School at Princetown, which was then probably built in the Barracks. But when Dartmoor Prison was re-opened in 1850, a new building for the School was needed and was built here. At its peak in 1861, 183 pupils were known to regularly attend.\nNote that this is not the later \u0026ldquo;Foggintor School\u0026rdquo;. That was also known as Four Winds and forms the large tree-lined car park half a mile south of our parking. We discuss that school in our Merrivale Calendar walk\nBetween 1880 and 1883, this building was also recorded as a Wesleyan Chapel, and later a Workshop and again as a private residence, so it clearly served multiple purposes.\nBy 1915 it was closed forever.\nHeritage Gateway -Methodist chapel / school at Foggintor Quarry Hill Cottages These are believed to have been built in the 1840s. The last resident left in 1951 and they were demolished two years later.\nYou can see where a branch railway line was laid out along Big Tip to carry waste for tipping. The railway gauge was about 2-feet for easy man-handling. It is recorded that only 10% of quarried granite was used in building, the rest was waste. Looking at the size of these tips, it is easy to believe that disposing of waste rock was a large part of the works here.\nMuch of the research for this walk was taken from Kath Brewer\u0026rsquo;s book, The Railways, Quarries and Cottages of Foggintor, Orchard Publications, Chudleigh, Newton Abbot, 1997. The cottage about the arch was her home.\nThe purpose of the arch is unknown. There is a suggestion that a waterwheel was located here, but there seems to be no evidence to support that.\nQuarry Entrance In the foreground of this picture are the remains of a crane base, at SX 56652 73658.\nFor our walk, we circle the quarry clockwise by climbing to the left above the quarry entrance\nThe 1840 Walkhampton Tithe Map shows Little King Tor and Great King Tor. It also shows the 1823 Plymouth \u0026amp; Dartmoor Railway, extended from King Tor quarries to Princetown by December 1826. It shows neither Foggin Tor nor the branch line to Foggintor Quarry. These were active well within Walkhampton Parish, although quarrying had nothing to do with tithing and therefore wasn\u0026rsquo;t suitable for the purpose of the map.\nFollow the level ground back towards Big Tip\nReturn walk It\u0026rsquo;s worth leaving the track after the field enclosures to walk below it, as per our route on the map, for some interesting historical items\nThis hut is labelled \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; in the figure below. Cairn 1 is a ruined cisted cairn. The area around Yellowmeade was occupied in Bronze Age times.\nParking There is a fair layby at the start of the track to Yellowmeade and Foggintor - which is in fact an old sand quarry. Please don\u0026rsquo;t block the track, it is in regular use.\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s full, there\u0026rsquo;s usually some space opposite, and some more a short way towards Princetown by the old pump house.\nReferences John Hallett (1994), Around Princetowns Quarries: The Tyrwhitt Railway Trail from Princetown.

There\u0026rsquo;s a gradual descent on the way out, and a corresponding climb on the return.\nSurrounded by Tors Bel Tor, on the other side of the hedge, has a Logan Stone, Rock Basins and a Triangulation Pillar. Sadly it is on private land and we cannot visit.\nDr Blackall Dr Thomas Blackwell MD FRCP (1814 - 4th May 1899, aged 85) trained at St George\u0026rsquo;s Hospital, London, and had a practice in Mayfair.\nHe was the youngest son of Dr John Blackall (1771-1860), the sixth son of Rev. Theophilus Blackall, who was a Prebendary (Honorary Canon) of Exeter Cathedral. John Blackall was an eminent physician who trained at St. Bartholomew\u0026rsquo;s Hospital, London, and then returned to Exeter in 1797, settling in Totnes in 1801. When he died in 1860, Thomas, his only surviving son inherited his estate.\nThomas bought the nearby Spitchwick Manor at Poundsgate in 1867. It seems that he never married but according to Censuses from 1861 onwards, there was always a \u0026ldquo;Visitor\u0026rdquo;, A Mrs Julia Tindall, and her daughter Caroline. It was Julia who inherited his estate when he died.\nIn the 1870/1880s, Thomas had the \u0026ldquo;Drive\u0026rdquo; constructed for his pleasure and for visiting guests to enjoy carriage rides driving southwards to enjoy the magnificent views down the River Dart valley.\n(This is disputed by Hemery (1987, p.588) who reports that it was cut \u0026ldquo;a century or so ago\u0026rdquo; by Gerald Warren and his family for Dr Joseph Blackall, of Spitchwick Manor.)\nStumble Corner Mel Tor We can leave the track here at Meltor Corner and make a short detour to the right to visit Mel Tor\nMel Tor is perhaps more accurately named \u0026ldquo;Mil Tor\u0026rdquo;, which is short for \u0026ldquo;Middle Tor\u0026rdquo; as it is twixt Sharp Tor and Hockinston Tor.\nThere is apparently an abandoned millstone near this tor, although we haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to locate it.\nRejoin Blackall\u0026rsquo;s drive and continue to the South\nSlotted Gateposts Note the inverted \u0026ldquo;L\u0026rdquo; slot in the post where timber would have been slid in and dropped forming a solid rail.\nThese slots are usually found five to a side, and form the basis of the \u0026ldquo;5 bar gate\u0026rdquo; phrase.\nElsewhere they are called \u0026ldquo;Slip gates\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Stang Stoops\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Yatsteads\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Hinge and L\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Stand Pole Gateways\u0026rdquo; being a common form of simple, but secure, gate.\nThere is a good Wikipedia Article showing some fine examples.\nThey were prone to damage at the ends of the rails and gradually fell out of use as iron became more available for hinges.\nHigher Uppacott is a Grade 1 listed longhouse from the early 14th century and is notable as its shippon has survived unchanged.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now owned by the Dartmoor National Park and was restored in 2018 as part of the Moor than Meets the Eye project.\nThere used to be a custom that involved the rolling of wooden wagon wheels down the hill of Mil Tor to the River Dart on Midsummer Day, but it fell into disuse during WW2.\nThe practice was revived for a time in the late 1950s but not for long. The idea was to roll them down the 600-foot hill but the rock-strewn nature of the ground stopped most of them.\nToday, the rusting iron tyres lie around in the wood, some with trees now growing up through them. Hemery p.589\nAish Tor This is metamorphic bedrock formed approximately 318 to 328 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period. Originally formed as sedimentary rocks in swamps, estuaries and deltas to form slates. Later altered by low-grade metamorphism i.e. heating during geologic processes such as the nearby intrusion of Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s molten magma (granite).\nThis cairn seems to sit on a raised circular hump of ground that might be an earlier cairn or kist, although this is unverified.\nThis may not be Aish Tor at all - the exact location seems disputed, and certainly indistinct. Not perhaps the most impressive of Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Tors.\nWe must now retrace our steps back to the car park\nWhilst it is tempting to walk the road back to the start to make this a circular walk, the road is narrow and traffic often heavy. It\u0026rsquo;s surely nicer to retrace our steps and admire the view from a different angle.\nYou may have noticed this on the way down as it\u0026rsquo;s beside the track. This is part of the ancient Bronze Age Mel Tor farmstead and enclosure, dating back around four thousand years.\nHeritage Gateway MDV6453 - Settlement east of Mel Tor\nParking Bell Tor Car park is free and right off the road.

The bedrock was laid down as sedimant in open seas about 359 to 383 million years ago.\nYennadon Stone is the last active stone quarry still working on moorland Dartmoor, out of scores that once existed.\nIron Mine \u0026ldquo;In 1836 Ralph Lopes leased the area to George Stone Baron to \u0026lsquo;dig work mine and search for Iron, Iron Ore, Iron Stone and all other Ores\u0026rsquo; on what was then called Great Yennadon Common, the rent being 1s 8d in the on the gross value according to the price on the day of all such ores metals and minerals which shall be \u0026hellip; digged raised and gotten out of from or in the said premises\u0026rdquo;\nThere was no lease following this, so it must be concluded the venture was unsuccessful. In 1846, another license was issued to other adventurers!\nWW2 Searchlight Battery This searchlight was operational from 9 Feb. 1944. It would help protect Plymouth, Burrator Reservoir and RAF Harrowbeer at Yelverton.\nAll that remains now are the outlines of a row of four huts, of which only one has anything obvious.\nClapper Bridge Steam Railway The first railway, the 1823 horse-drawn PDR of Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt has already been mentioned.\nThe second railway was the 1883 [Princetown Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princetown_Railway0 (using steam locomotives) that replaced it, runnning from Yelverton to Princetown.\nThis one connected with the 1859 South Devon and Tavistock Railway Company (SD\u0026amp;TR) Plymouth-Tavistock line. It was adopted by the GWR from 1st January 1922 and closed March 3rd, 1956.\nThe horse-drawn tramway consisted of short wagons that could be pulled in quite a tight turn. The line enters this image at the far right, from the gateway seen above, swings around a hairpin bend (kindly marked by the sheep) and doubles back towards the camera at the left, from where it goes through the first gate above up to Iron Mine Lane and on to Princetown via the west side of the Down.\nThe steam railway could not turn a tight bend like this and was built running into this image at the bottom left and on into the distance towards the reservoir where it ran around the flank of the Down above the dam to Burrator \u0026amp; Sheepstor Halt and then on to Princetown, travelling up the east side of the Down.\nCattle Creep These \u0026ldquo;creeps\u0026rdquo; (simply small tunnels) were installed at intervals along the railway to enable livestock to cross underneath the railway which would have been fenced along its route to keep livestock from entering the tracks.\nBronze Age Hut Circle Bench with a view \u0026ldquo;One of the boundary stones which marked the sett has in fact survived, the existence of which had been overlooked by previous Dartmoor explorers and writers until I discovered it some years ago.

This was a major industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries employing hundreds of people, and many ruins and reminders remain. The main route is firm and easy going, with a gentle hill on the final climb back to the car park.\nNote: The track along the valley, although firm underfoot, is often very wet all year round. Sensible footwear recommended.\nDo feel free to explore the area and leave our track - there are many points of interest, some of which we\u0026rsquo;ve marked on the map and all are worth exploring.\nThe Four Aces From the parking, on a clear day, you can see three rock walled enclosures across the valley. Together with a fourth (see map, central), these are known as the \u0026ldquo;Four Aces\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The Devil\u0026rsquo;s Playing Cards\u0026rdquo;.\nLegend tells\u0026hellip; Jan Reynolds was a tin miner from Widecombe who was more interested in drinking and gambling than in going to church on a Sunday. Finding himself short of money he made a deal with the Devil: in return for money to fund his gambling the Devil could have his soul if he was found asleep in church.\nJan soon forgot the pact and one Sunday he fell asleep while playing cards in church. There was a sound of horses’ hooves outside, and a flash of lightning so fierce that it tore off the top of the church tower, then the Devil strode into the church and snatched up the terrified miner, carrying him up into the sky and across the moor. Jan had four aces in his hand and he dropped them in what is now known as the Aces Field.\nOne can quite clearly see a diamond shape, but it taxes the imagination to see the shape of a Heart, a Club and a Spade in these fields.\nThe reality of these enclosures is that they were either to keep rabbits in or rabbits out. The farm just over the hill to the Easy is Headland Warren Farm, which was known to breed rabbits which formed a large part of the miner\u0026rsquo;s diet. I\u0026rsquo;m unclear whether the rabbits were kept in these enclosures, or they were built for growing crops which needed protecting.\nTake the path Eastwards into the valley for about half a mile\nVitifer Mine Also known as Vityfer\nMany of the paths in this area are formed of growan - decomposed granite - which makes for good walking.\nThis area contains the remains of four distinct mines:\nVitifer (Prev: Vytifer) Mine Birch Tor Mine Easy Birch Tor Mine (AKA Headland Mine) Golden Dagger Mine. Vitifer and Birch Tor were separate mines originally, then combined, then separated, and then combined again. Naming of these two seems interchangeable, with both workings being known by both names.\nThe chimney was between the blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s shop and the miners\u0026rsquo; dry - and the wall of the carpenter\u0026rsquo;s shop at extreme left, with Challacombe Down behind.\nThe flue here runs underneath and heated what was the \u0026ldquo;Miner\u0026rsquo;s dry\u0026rdquo; - a place where miners would hang their clothes, soaked from working underground in dripping and partially flooded adits and stopes.\nA fireplace or boiler would have been placed at the far end of the flue, and the smoke run through it to the chimney, which released it high enough not to bother those at ground level.\nThe turbine house does not appear in the 1904 OS map, so was likely built after that.\nThese mines were powered mostly by water, by the Birch Tor and Vitifer Mine Leat which travelled for 7 miles.\nLarge waterwheels were used here for pumping out water, raising ore from shafts and driving the crushing stamps.\nSmaller waterwheels were used for other work, such as driving the \u0026ldquo;sweeps\u0026rdquo; that swept the crushed ore on the buddles at the lower edge of the workings.\nGolden Dagger Mine This mine was named after a bronze dagger was found here from the early men who lived here four thousand years ago.\nThe dagger was taken to Plymouth Museum, and rumoured to have been destroyed during World War 2 bombing of that building.\nA replica dagger is owned by DNPA and can sometimes be seen at their information centres and displays.\nThis area was mined for Tin from at least the fifteenth century via surface streaming.\nMines were dug to chase tin further underground from around the 1750s. Given the amount of surface water in this area, one imagines these were very wet mines and hard to keep dewatered.\nThe underground workings ended in 1914 when many men were drafted for the First World War. Some surface working remained until 1939 when again, the needs of war took labour away from the moors.\nDinah\u0026rsquo;s House This building was so named because Dinah Hext and her children lived here in 1860s and 1870s, having moved a short way up the valley from Challacombe.\n\u0026ldquo;CEH 1832\u0026rdquo; in cement on lower side, southern end of the house. It was also apparently once a dormitory (Called a \u0026ldquo;barracks\u0026rdquo;) and meeting place for miners.\nEngine House Center: Petter Engine (The Lister-Petter company is still in business today) Gas Engine (Extreme Right) Gas producing plant (center distant) A Magnetic Separator was left of the camera A winter turbine generator was right of the camera A summer generator was beyond the Petter Engine Buddle A buddle is a simple structure to separate material out by its density.\nFine sediment is introduced at the centre point by trough or pipe in suspension with water. As it flows towards the outer edge, heavier material is deposited first.\nSome buddles are assisted by rotary brushes.\nOnce sufficient sediment has built up, it is shovelled out with the \u0026ldquo;headings\u0026rdquo; containing the more valuable minerals in the centre, and the less valuable or waste known as \u0026ldquo;tailings\u0026rdquo; towards the edge.\nThis one is known to have been fed by a slurry onto the cone by a small leat arrangement and swept by a waterwheel-driven \u0026ldquo;wood and rags sweeps\u0026rdquo;\nThis is the far point of our walk - we must return along the same track and view the workings from a different angle\nParking There is hard parking at the given coordinates which lead directly into our walk.\nReferences Dartefacts Dartmoor Trust Archive Heritage Gateway - Birch Tor and Vitifer Mines - Golden Dagger Mine Old Maps Some of the old maps showing the layout of these mines in busier times.\nOS 25-inch Single Sheet map 1885/1886 - red buildings OS 25-inch map 1892-1914 Series - showing Warren House Inn, Birch Tor \u0026amp; Vitifer Tin Mine and Golden DaggerTin Mine OS 25-inch Single Sheet map Surv.1885/Publ.1886 - old detail of Vitifer, Birch Tor and Golden Dagger Mines ","date":"2024-12-09T17:20:03Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/vitifer-and-golden-dagger-mines/27_hu9541175173676129661.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/vitifer-and-golden-dagger-mines/","title":"Vitifer and Golden Dagger Mines"},{"content":"Information Distance: 4 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words keeps.plug.ambitions Map Introduction A walk including some hills through Haytor and historic quarries from previous centuries. Points of interest include abandoned machinery, the Haytor Granite Tramway (The Templer Way), an abandoned partially-carved apple crusher and ruined buildings including a \u0026lsquo;beehive\u0026rsquo; quarryman\u0026rsquo;s hut.\nWe start from the Upper Haytor car park, marked on the map as the lower P and white/green cross. Walk upwards towards the imposing Haytor\nHaytor Haytor The name is a cartographer\u0026rsquo;s corruption of the local name of High Tor, pronounced in the Dartmoor dialect as \u0026ldquo;Hey Tor\u0026rdquo;.\nThese are granite intrusions that are seen from a long way off, even from The English Channel, and are hence, the \u0026ldquo;high tor\u0026rdquo;.\nWith rock piles separated by an area of grass, it is also called an \u0026ldquo;avenue tor\u0026rdquo;. Other Avenue Tors are Bellever Tor, Hound Tor, Great Staple (or, originally, Steeple) Tor, Rippon Tor, and Pew Tor.\nRock climbers and abseilers use Haytor often.\nOn special occasions, a bonfire is sometimes set on the exposed flat rocks of Low Man by the local community in agreement with the local Authority and Landowner. These celebration fires, which have likely occured for millenia, can be seen for a huge distance.\nOn the very top of Low Man is a hole drilled by the Victorians to hold a flagpole.\nThe Victorians also carved steps into Haytor and erected a wrought-iron handrail to help them climb the rock with more ease. The steps, somewhat weathered, still exist, but only stubs of the ironwork remain. Stairs and a similar handrail still exist at Blackingstone Rock.\nThe adventurous may wish to climb Haytor. You will find the staps up the shallower grade, with a small leap across to the main rock.\nThis is not an easy climb and advised only for the fit and agile with suitable footwear, and to be avoided by all in icy or windy weather for obvious reasons.\nFor our walk, we turn right in front of Haytor and head Northeast for about 500m\nHaytor Quarry At the fence, follow it down to the right until you come into a small gate where you may enter the quarry.\nThis crane would have been used to lift blocks of rough-cut granite out of the quarry below, and also on and off wheeled trams for transport down the Haytor Granite Tramway for loading onto barges at Stover, and then by boat to Teignmouth for transport internationally.\nNotably, granite from this quarry was used in many fine London buildings including Nelson\u0026rsquo;s Column and London Bridge.\nDNPA infosheet on Granite Quarry and the Haytor Granite Tramway - including sketch of how this crane would once looked The Templer Family These quarries were started in 1813 by a George Templer (1781-1843), who also build the Haytor Granite Tramway.\nGeorge\u0026rsquo;s father, James Templer II (1748-1813) built Stover Canal nearby, which was originally used to transport Ball Clay from the Bovey Basin to factories worldwide, including those used for Wedgewood Porcelain. The Stover canal was later also used for the export of stone from here.\nGeorge\u0026rsquo;s grandfather, James Templer (1722-1782) built Stover House\nUnfortunately, George overspent and he was forced to sell the family estate; Stover House, Stover Canal and the Haytor Granite Tramway. These were bought by Edward St Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset - \u0026ldquo;Lord Seymour\u0026rdquo; (1775-1855)\nAt that time, Haytor quarries were leased by the Johnson Brothers in 1840, who closed them within a few years. It is known they were having problems with \u0026ldquo;the Union\u0026rdquo; and it seems likely this was linked. The brothers also leased Foggintor quarries and sold stone from there under the Haytor Granite Company name, which was misleading to customers as the Haytor granite was known to be of better quality.\nSeven years later, the Haytor lease was up for renewal and the Duke refused to extend it, but the quarry never re-opened.\nThe crane was still functional in 1946 and a photograph taken in 1964 shows it still standing.\nHeritage Gateway page MDV43350 - Machinery at Haytor Quarries The lilies, and the goldfish and occasional koi you may see, were introduced well after the closing of the quarries.\nSwimming is not advised!\nAs well as hidden hazards underwater, there are a great many leeches in these ponds! If you study the water edges you may see them wriggling.\nIn 1986, as part of a Youth Training Scheme (YTS), I was part of a group of youths who carried water barrels, rope and pallets up to these quarries. We were tasked, as part of a confidence-building course run by Torbay Council, to build a raft and cross this pit. These rings came in very useful in securing our pulling ropes \u0026ndash; Simon\nQuarry Waste tips We walk through the gate and meander down to the right below the heaps\nThe flat top is where iron rails once rested to run the trucks out from the quarry to tip waste rock.\nThis functional design is found worldwide wherever quarries and mines needs spoil disposing of. A much larger example can be found at Foggintor Quarry.\nHaytor Granite Tramway The gauge of the track is 4 foot 3 inches (1295mm) with the rails being shaped granite blocks.\nNote that because there were no flanges, the inner part of the rails is of differing heights and hasn\u0026rsquo;t been as carefully worked - because it only existed to steer the wheels back onto the lower, flatter, part.\nThis Haytor Tramway wagon is kept at the DNPA Head Office at Parke, Bovey Tracey.\nThe wagons were connected together in \u0026rsquo;trains\u0026rsquo; of 12 or so, drawn by a team of 18 or 19 horses in single file.\nThe horses were placed behind the train going down when they provided much needed braking, and in front of the train when pulling the empty wagons back to the quarries.\n\u0026#34;Nineteen stout horses it was known, From Holwell Quarry drew the stone, And mounted on twelve-wheeled car \u0026#39;Twas safely brought from Holwell Tor\u0026#34; -- Thomas Taverner At junctions the wheels were guided by \u0026lsquo;point tongues\u0026rsquo;, pivoted on the granite-block rails.\nThis could be described as an early form of a railway \u0026ldquo;switchplate\u0026rdquo;. Authorities differ on whether the point tongues were oak or iron.\nThis is Holwell Junction on the tramway, looking back the way we\u0026rsquo;ve come.\nThe left branch leads to Haytor Quarry whilst straight ahead leads to Holwell Quarry, Rubble Heap Quarry, Harrow Barrow Quarry and Haytor West Quarry.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll return here shortly, but for now, continue downhill for a hundred meters.\nA set of \u0026ldquo;going nowhere\u0026rdquo; points at SX 75795 77772. Some of these branches are not shown on the old 1886 map (surveyed in 1885).\nIt can only be assumed these were cut for a future line or quarry that was never constructed, for they clearly hold no purpose.\nFor now, turn around and return to Holwell Junction, and carry straight on to the West.\nRubble Heap Junction Rubble Heap Junction: straight on leads to Rubble Heap Quarry, Harrow Barrow and West Quarries. Right turns down to Holwell Quarry.\nBear right here to Holwell Quarry.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;d like a shorter walk, you can continue ahead and skip the Holwell Quarry visit\nHolwell Quarry This carving was the base for an apple mill used for cider making.\nOne can imagine the frustration of the carver when it broke. It\u0026rsquo;s not known whether it broke in the carving, or was damaged in transport.\nThere are five separate quarries on Haytor Down: Haytor (Main) Quarry, Holwell Quarry, Rubble Heap Quarry, Harrow Barrow (Emsworthy East Quarry) and Western Quarry (Emsworthy West Quarry).\n\u0026ldquo;Emsworthy\u0026rdquo; names are sometimes used because of the proximity of Emsworthy (Hemsworthy) Rocks, between Haytor and Saddle Tor.\nBeehive This can be found a short way below the tramway near to its end.\nThe hut is known locally as \u0026ldquo;The Beehive\u0026rdquo; due to its conical shape, and was possibly used as an explosives store, or a shelter during blasting.\nWe now return back up the track to Rubble Heap Junction and turn right\nContinuing along the tramway to the Southwest for around 300 meters until you find;\nRubble Heap Quarry From here, we return to the quarry entrance and walk towards Haytor across open moorland\nTo finish the walk, descend down to the Higher car park where we started\nParking This walk starts from the upper Haytor car park, which is Pay and Display. Through the summer, free on-moor parking is provided between lower and upper Haytor Car parks, or you could start from the Saddle Tor car park to the West, although this gets very full at peak times\nThe Lower Car park has toilets and an information centre\nReferences Legendary Dartmoor - Haytor Quarries ","date":"2024-12-09T09:50:47Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/haytor-rocks-and-quarries/11_hu16836591998769536607.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/haytor-rocks-and-quarries/","title":"Haytor Rocks and Quarries"},{"content":"Information Distance: 2 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Gentle A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words masks.calibrate.burden Map Introduction This walk is mostly on open moorland avoiding steep hills. There is a huge amount of unique history here that cannot fail to make one pause and wonder.

An isolated spot surrounded by trees on the B3357 road between the Dartmoor Inn, at Merrivale, and the turnoff to Princetown on the road to Two Bridges. This is marked by the yellow cross and the the P symbol on the map.\nLeave the car park due west, running parallel to the road.\nApple Crusher The round object in the left foreground is often described as an abandoned runner, that is, the running wheel, that would be turned on an axle pulled by a horse with the stone running in a circular trough crushing apples for making cider: i.e. an abandoned apple crusher.\nHowever, that is not accurate\u0026hellip;\nIn 1905, the Western Morning News and other papers published a story about this stone, claiming it was a buried quoit or dolmen with a worked capstone.\nWe can be fairly sure that this report was inaccurate thanks to William Crossing, who wrote in Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Early History \u0026amp; Medieval remains, Chap 12\neventually a man was found before any scientific paper was written who pronounced: \u0026ldquo;Twadn\u0026rsquo;t no old man cut thacky stone,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;I cut\u0026rsquo;n.\u0026rdquo; This is an abandoned top-stone to a crazing mill, an old way of grinding tin ore before it was smelted.\nMerrivale Quarry In the distance we can see Merrivale Quarry.\nWilliam Duke opened this as \u0026ldquo;Tor Quarry\u0026rdquo; in 1876, its operations absorbing the old sett-making craft previously carried out under the Steeple Tors.\nAs well as cutting setts, Granite from this quarry was also used for Gravestones, agricultural rollers. It also provided the facing for the New Scotland Yard building in London.\nThe quarry closed in 1997, spending its final years dressing imported stone from Norway.\nThe name \u0026ldquo;Merrivale\u0026rdquo; for this part of Walkhampton Common is said to derive from \u0026ldquo;mara val\u0026rdquo; in old Cornish, meaning \u0026ldquo;plague market\u0026rdquo;. This is thought to have been corrupted from \u0026ldquo;tin market\u0026rdquo;, although \u0026ldquo;potato market\u0026rdquo; has also been suggested.\nIn times of the Black Death (1348-1353: when 50 million people died in Europe (Not to be confused with the Great Plague of London, 1665-1666), farmers left food here for Tavistock people who left coins as payment soaking in vinegar to clean them of the badness.\n\u0026ldquo;Mar val\u0026rdquo; has also been interpreted as Mirey Vale.\nHeritage Gateway article for this hut circle Both stone rows are double - that is consisting of two rows of stones about a meter apart. This row has the ruins of a cairn, ring cairn or cairn circle associated with this end. (The ring of stones)\nThe double nature of the row is seen well here. The first, larger, stone in the row casts its shadow quite symmetrically onto the blocking stone at mid-winter solstice.\nLong Ash Leat is seen at the very bottom of the photograph and Roos Tor, SX 543 766, elevation 454 metres (1489 feet) on the skyline.

The function of this stone has been suggested in Dartmoor Sun as a midwinter sunset marker when viewed from a leaning stone at SX 55461 74683.\nLong Ash Pits Early, possibly medieval or even earlier, tin workings where tinners collected alluvial deposits along stream beds.\nThe eroded tin ore could form quite pure tin gravel in such areas, having been washed down from the surrounding granite.\nThe early tinners \u0026ldquo;leated\u0026rdquo; water to a trench at the lower end of the ground, called a \u0026rsquo;tye\u0026rsquo; and water was used to wash away the lighter \u0026lsquo;gangue\u0026rsquo; gravels.\nThis method left banks of waste behind. The area is surrounded by a scarp that shows the original level of the land and the depth of the deposits.\nTin streaming was often followed by open cast mining to go deeper, into big cuttings called \u0026ldquo;gerts\u0026rdquo;, but this is not seen here.\nIt was presumably this water source that was diverted and used for washing away the lighter sediments so as to leave the heavier tin-bearing gravels and sands for smelting. This would have been among the earliest tin-extraction methods.\nThis photograph also shows the scarp surrounding this area that suggests how much the early tinners changed the look of the landscape.\nPackhorse Trail In the photograph above, a portion of the pillar has been enhanced to show the \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; more clearly, facing towards Ashburton.\nIn the Middle Ages,this trading route was very important, especially for wool and cloth or yarn, going via Sheepstor - which was famed for its sheep and wool.\nThe track was superseded by the turnpike road in 1792.\nStrangers to the moor often had to tackle this high lonely route, this section over the Princetown area was the highest part and the most exposed. Princetown, or Thomas Tyrwhitt\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Prince\u0026rsquo;s Town\u0026rdquo;, did not exist in those days.\nGuide posts were erected along the way and what we see today are possibly the more \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo; (1669) improved series, which were sponsored by Plymouth Corporation at the princely sum of £2.\nClapper Bridge This picture features a \u0026ldquo;pinch\u0026rdquo; stile that was to keep sheep out of the old school grounds, but allowing access to a path over the small clapper bridge crossing the Long Ash Leat.\nThis leat was built in the 1880s to take water Long Ash.\nFour Winds School Four Winds was the site of Foggintor School, built 1914, opened April 1915 with 55 children from the nearby cottages associated with Foggintor and other quarries.\nMr \u0026amp; Mrs Stoyle were the teachers, it was a spacious building with a wood block floor and central heating - the pipes were used for warming their pasties.\nThere were periods of closure due to snow and whooping cough. The garden had bees, poultry, a goat and rabbits.\nBesides the school building there was also School House, for the teachers. One section of the enclosure was the playing field.\nThe school was run throughout its history by Fred Stoyle, the youngest head-teacher in the country.\nTheir son, Ivan, planted the Christmas tree from 1924 in the school garden and this is the tree that stands there today - over a hundred years later.\nAfter the school closed in 1936, the teachers\u0026rsquo; house was renamed \u0026ldquo;Four Winds\u0026rdquo;. The school buildings were demolished in 1964 and the private house in 1965.\nStone from the buildings was used in the road modifications at Devil\u0026rsquo;s Elbow near Princetown. From this, we know that the tree is in the old garden and the other enclosure used to be the play area.\nFoggintor Mission School Before Foggintor School was built, there was another school opposite the entrance to the track to Yellowmead. This was in the Foggintor Mission Hall, built in 1887. It served also as a school from Aug. 1896, opening with 41 pupils.\nIt had 95 pupils in 1903 and closed in Sep. 1912. The building was demolished in 1965. The numbers of young children give some idea of the population in the area, associated mainly with the busy quarries.\nReferences These sources were used when researching this walk:\nJack Walker, 2005, Dartmoor Sun, Halsgrove Discover Series, Halsgrove Publishing, Tiverton, Devon.

Then we walk along the Conchies Road and learn about this piece of World War One history before visiting an ancient burial cist.\nThere are a few short optional diversions to visit other cists along the way.\nPrincetown Prince\u0026rsquo;s Town was built by Thomas Tyrwhitt (1762-1833) and named in honour of the Prince of Wales, to whom he was Private Secretary. Thomas also built roads across Dartmoor and many other features. He was one of the Georgian Improvers who wanted to turn the \u0026ldquo;wastes\u0026rdquo; of Dartmoor into a thriving place to live and work.\nTyrwhitt was MP for Okehampton (1796-1802), Portarlington (1802-1806) and Plymouth (1806-1812). He built Dartmoor Prison in 1809 for French prisoners taken in the Napoleonic wars and it was also used for Americans taken in the 1812 war. He also built the Plymouth \u0026amp; Dartmoor Railway, which was originally a horse-dawn tramway that was later converted by the Great Western Railway to steam.\n2024: The Duchy Hotel has been rented from the Duchy of Cornwall by Dartmoor National Park Authority since 1991 for a fixed rent of £100 as an information centre. In November this year it was announced that despite informing almost 50,000 visitors this year, it is to close in May 2025 due to a shortfall in funding. Reference - ITV\nDrinking Fountain Dartmoor Prison Jonathan Stones tells me that he was told by \u0026lsquo;Sonny\u0026rsquo; Williams (an old farm hand) that he helped one Val Forder (sometime tenant of Sunnyside when a Duchy Farm) to transport the said gate from its original working position at Dousland. It\u0026rsquo;s second life here was as a \u0026lsquo;cattle crush\u0026rsquo;.\nAerial Ropeway The ropeway bringing timber from from Brimpts Plantation, powered by an engine at Moorlands Farm, ended nearby but I am told nothing visible remains. Many will remember old photographs in the Plume of Feathers in James Langton\u0026rsquo;s time showing the ropeway in action.\nThe ropeway was essentially an overhead cable supported by large wooden pylons that allowed relatively easy transport of wood from Brimpts, some four miles distant. Imagine something similar to a modern a ski lift, with logs suspended instead of skiiers.\nDevonport Leat Bachelors Hall Forest of Dartmoor 1840 Tithe Map showing a mine at bottom left in Plot 119 marked \u0026ldquo;Mine\u0026rdquo;, close to Bachelors Hall.\nThere is another structure in Plot 116, this being an un-named plot owned (also) by George Nicholson Esquire and leased to William Mitchell, as this appears to have a wheelpit and a stream as a water supply it can inferred that this is the smelting house (see following).\nThere are two lines drawn across the mine area. The left one (through \u0026ldquo;119\u0026rdquo;, coloured blue) was the original Bachelors Mine Leat that became the prison foul (an open sewer) and extended away from the mine. The thinner line (through the \u0026ldquo;9\u0026rdquo; of \u0026ldquo;119\u0026rdquo;) was its replacement, Blackabrook Leat.\nHeritage Gateway page on Bachelors Hall Tin Mine\nLooking at our map below, we\u0026rsquo;ve marked some points of interest here relating to the mine:\nA series of small tin pits, possibly contemporary with the early open-cast working of the area. Three shafts: Footway, Engine and Ann\u0026rsquo;s shafts, running NNE-SSW along the main tin lode. All 3 are now collapsed and capped. A whim, attached to Engine shaft about 11m in diameter within a bank 3.5m wide, 0.6m high with entrance in the WSW. Shallow adit, one of 3 adits known to have been associated with the mine. Two dressing floors with associated earthen platforms for buddles. Two wheel pits associated with stamps and dressing floors. The main wheelpit. A pump-rod gulley from the main waterwheel up to Engine shaft. The prison, or foul leat. Initially called the Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s Hall Leat and only extending as far as the mine was once the only source of water. After being taken over for use by the prison, mainly for sewage disposal, it was extended south and discontinued from mine use. It is now defunct. Blackbrook leat - its construction probably necessitated by the original leat being used for the prison. This is also defunct. Small reservoirs associated with the treatment areas of the mine. Areas of ridge and furrow cultivation, possibly contemporary with the mine. The Devonport, or Dock, Leat skirting the east side of the mine. Heritage Gateway page on bachelors Hall\nThe building is generally accepted as the site of the corn mill and bakery (permission dated 1798 but built post-1809), later converted to a Naphtha Works; the ruin downstream is thought to be a smelting works.\nBoth documentary and map sources indicate the existence of other buildings at Bachelors Hall. Thomas Tyrwhitt built a late 18th century house here and a few years later he was granted a lease to build a corn mill; this suggests two separate buildings.\nThe tithe map and census returns both imply the existence of a farm at Bachelors Hall which if proved would have co-existed with mill cottages for the short duration of the Naphtha Works.\nA second 19th century Duchy map shows Bachelors Hall as an L-shape building slightly larger than it is today.\nA building depicted downstream is allegedly the smelting works, and two structures higher up the hillside to the west annotated `Brewery\u0026rsquo;.\nThe 1839 Tithe Map depicts a building here of L-shape with other buildings and the farm outbuildings more or less as they are today.\nDetour below Bachelors Hall It\u0026rsquo;s a short and interesting diversion to continue down through the Hall on the marked footpath, then return back up. A few pictures of this follow.\nThe track is the left section of the photograph. The building appears on the tithe map image at the top edge.\nIt may be that this is the original house built by Tyrwhitt in the late 1700s and the modern buildings are where there were cottages for mill, bakery or mine workers.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re ready, end the Detour by returning to the track Smelting House Heritage Gateway Page for this Smelting House\nA tin smelting house was in operation at \u0026lsquo;Bachelors Hall\u0026rsquo; near Princetown from 1798-1807. It was erected by T Gray in 1795.\nSmelting is the process in which ingots of metal are won from the crushed ore by the process of heating until the metal is liquid - in this case Tin. The furnace is heated by whatever fuel is available - probably wood or charcoal here.\nIn the late 1790\u0026rsquo;s, John Swete described the smelting house as \u0026lsquo;on the banks of a small stream which emptied into Blackabrook\u0026rsquo; having stamping mills.\nDuchy of Cornwall records date from 1798-1804 that indicate 223 ingots were smelted in that period weighing 27.43 tonnes with a further 1.07 tonnes listed for 1807.\nIn sale particulars of 1828, the smelting house had been converted to a brewery.\nThe site of the brewery is shown on the sale plan as being beside the west bank of the stream where agricultural buildings now stand. The photograph above shows the presumed wheelpit for the stamping mill and combines blowing house.\nUsing these figures: 27.43 tonnes (metric) = 60,346 lbs (UK) = 270 lbs/ingot = 2.4 cwt. That is 121 kg or two small adults. Poor pack ponies.\nModern history of forestry on Dartmoor The building of nearby Tor Royal by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt at Prince\u0026rsquo;s Town was completed in 1798 and through the first decade of the 1800\u0026rsquo;s there were experimental plantings of coniferous shelterbelts to protect it.\nThe Duchy of Cornwall established a plantation at Brimpts in 1862. Forestry grew after WW1 in an effort to replace the country\u0026rsquo;s greatly depleted timber stock.\nBy 1930, plantations had been established at Fernworthy, Bellever, Brimpts, Bear Down, Soussons and Frenchbeer (Chagford) and in 1930 these areas were sold to the Forestry Commission (founded in 1919).\nBy 1938, the eastern slopes of Bellever Tor and Lakehead Hill were planted and the western slopes between 1940-1943. Source: The New Forests of Dartmoor (1964), London HMSO, Forestry Commission booklet No. 10, pages 6-10.\nThe tree of choice for planting on Dartmoor is the Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis, chosen for its high productivity compared to e.g. Douglas fir, Norway spruce, European larch and other fast-growing conifers. (text from the walk on 25 February 2018).\nBull Park Farm Bull Park farm was built by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt for a cattle-herdsman some time before 1833. Its enclosures were used to segregate bulls from cows and calves when not required for breeding.\nThe last tenant farmer quit on Christmas Day, 1957, and the property then became a holiday cottage.\nIt is now a private home and the owners told me that the old shed was the bull shed and still has rings in the wall for tying the bulls.\nThe Conchie Road This starts the \u0026ldquo;Conchie Road\u0026rdquo;.\nDuring the First World War, all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 41 were required to fight for their country. (Except for clergy, teachers and certain classes of industrial worker)\nParliament article about the Conscription Law\nOf those men, any who refused to fight for moral or other rules were labelled \u0026ldquo;Conscientious objectors\u0026rdquo;, or Conchies. They were not a well liked group of men, seen as cowards and abused and taunted by men and women alike.\nAs they would not fight or contribute to the war effort, they were treated as prisoners. Some were housed in Dartmoor Prison and as punishment for their \u0026ldquo;cowardice\u0026rdquo;, they were given hard labour.\nOne particularly pointless form of this work was to build this road. It goes nowhere and serves no purpose.\nThe work will have been hard and brutal. Stones taken both locally and from the Dartmoor Prison Quarry would have been hit repeatedly by sledgehammers until they were small enough to be packed into a solid base to form the road, again by packing with hammers or heavy tamps, and heavy man-powered rollers.\nAs you can see, there is little protection from the wind and driving wind up here. In winter especially, this would have been a truly miserable task.\nSuggested detour If you\u0026rsquo;re enjoying the walk, you may like to extend it by a mile or so by walking cross-moor North to Blakey Tor and back.\nThis is marked on the map as a dotted red line and takes in a pretty, rarely visited tor and another two ancient burial cists.\nDartmoor contains an unusally high occurence of cists, or burial cairns. These are stone tombs dating back to the Bronze age, some four thousand years ago. We know of several hundred of these, and more are still being found, having been buried by the peat\nEnd the suggested detour by returning to the Conchie Road as per the map Crock of Gold There\u0026rsquo;s no definite record of why this cist was so called. People have speculated that a crock (jar) of gold was found here, perhaps buried with the body that was once here.\nOr perhaps it was just wistful thinking, that grave robbers might find rich pickings? There are other Dartmoor similarly named - the Money Pit on Yar Tor is one such.\nParking Directions are provided for the main Princetown car park. This is pay and display, but off-peak you may find nearby on-road parking for free. Please do be considerate for the residents.\nNearby The Dartmoor Prison Museum is well worth a visit. The Fox Tor Cafe has excellent food The Old Police Station cafe also does good food, particularly fish and chips.

The return route takes in some relatively unknown Welstor Common Rifle Range, dating back to 1861 and pre-dates the much larger training range to the East.\nLeave the car park across the road to the Southwest\nBoundary Stones EPB stands for Edmund Pollexfen Bastard, Lord of the Manor of Buckland in the Moor.\nHe is also mentioned on the cross at Buckland Manor and several other nearby stones. These were erected to mark the boundary of Buckland Manor in 1837, a year before his death.\nA = Ashburton, B = Buckland. Also has EPB roughly carved on one side.\nThe old (left in this picture) and new boundary stones, marked A, B and EPB as above.\nThe Welstor Newtake wall behind was built in 1771 to enclose open moorland for grazing. We keep it on our left all the way to Buckland Beacon.\nHistorically, on Dartmoor, \u0026ldquo;newtakes\u0026rdquo; were enclosures of common land for agricultural purposes, and also to exclude others from grazing it. This practice often led to conflict between commoners who held rights over the land, and the landowners who erected these walls.\nDevil\u0026rsquo;s Hoofprint This interesting little copse looks like it may have been planted to shelter a house at some time, but no such remains are known. In any regard, it is a nice place to rest on a summer\u0026rsquo;s day.\nSheep creep The Ten Commandments Stones Reaching Buckland Beacon, we pass by on its left side and find the commandment stones laying open like the pages of a book.\nThe stones were commissioned by William Whitely of Wellstor, Lord of Buckland Manor, in 1928, in celebration of the rejection by Parliament of a proposed new Book of Common Prayer that was deemed \u0026ldquo;too popish\u0026rdquo; by many.\nThere are two dates on the stones: 15th Dec 1927 and 14 June 1928, that are the dates on which the revised book was rejected.\nWhen it was realised that there would be room to spare, the third verse of the hymn \u0026ldquo;Oh God our help in ages past\u0026rdquo; was added to the second stone.\nThere are 1,547 letters on the two stones and, due to weathering, the stones have needed to be recut several times, sometimes highlighted in black paint to aid legibility. This recutting is known to have happened in 1995, 2009, 2017 and most recently in 2020 as part of the \u0026ldquo;Moor than Meets the Eye\u0026rdquo; project.\nLefthand inscription I AM\nEx. 3 14\nTHE LORD THY GOD\nI\nTHOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER\nGODS BUT ME\nII\nTHOU SHALT NOT MAKE TO THYSELF\nANY GRAVEN IMAGES NOR THE\nLIKENESS OF ANYTHING THAT IS IN\nIN HEAVEN ABOVE OR IN THE EARTH\nBELOW OR IN THE WATER UNDER THE\nEARTH.

Note: These firing positions are not at all obvious and they were originally probably little more than low earth banks for the men to lie down to aim from.\nOne supposes that wooden or canvas targets were raised above it, with the stone structure providing shelter for the range operators.\nDevon \u0026amp; Dartmoor Heritage \u0026ldquo;Rifle Range on Welstor Common\u0026rdquo; includes: \u0026ldquo;A rifle range was established on Welstor Common in 1861 for use by the Ashburton Rifle Volunteers and represents the earliest recorded military training within the Rippon Tor PAL (Premier Archaeological Landscape). It continued in use until at least 1886 when depicted on the First Edition Ordnance Survey map, but by the time of the Second Edition (1905) it was absent, although William Crossing refers to it in his 1912 Guide to Dartmoor.\u0026rdquo;\nThere is a World War 2 Rifle range nearby on Halshanger Common. (It is the massive brick structure you may already have seen on this walk a mile or so to the East)\nHeritage Gateway page for this quarry Welstor Common rifle range page states: The target storehouse/shelter with its massive stone wall facing the firing lines. This rifle range was created in 1861 for the use of the Ashburton Rifle Volunteers. It was in use until about 1900, the 1905 OS map does not record it. There is very little evidence on the ground with the exception of this structure which was near the west end of the stop butt. There is a partially collapsed corrugated iron roof inside. the small quarry to the southwest appears to post date the rifle range.\nAshburton Golf Course From 1910 to the mid 1920s, this was the home of the Ashburton Golf Course - although no sign of it remains.\n\u0026ldquo;On Wednesday 16th February 1910 Mr J T Barker presided at a meeting in the Market Hall to discuss and consider the proposed golf club for Ashburton. The chairman stated that a committee had already been appointed to try and find a suitable location for the course and as a result a large portion of land on Welstor Common had been obtained. It had been generously offered by Mr Parnell Tucker at a nominal rent, he was also willing to erect a clubhouse which could also be rented. The area had been inspected by several experts and a professional all of them were strongly in favour of the location.\u0026rdquo;\nNote that the hanger is wedged in with iron feathers, showing it predates the more modern epoxy method of fixing which has been more generally used since the 1980s\nParking is usually to be had at Cold East Cross - marked with a yellow cross on the map.\n","date":"2024-12-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/buckland-beacon-ten-commandments-stone/16_hu15978079520052166680.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/buckland-beacon-ten-commandments-stone/","title":"Buckland Beacon, Ten Commandments Stone"},{"content":"Information Distance: 3 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Gentle A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words aside.explained.package Map We\u0026rsquo;ve used numbers in the photographs which correspond to the map to help with identification\nHigher Cherry Brook Bridge The Hairy Hands This road is famously recorded as having a pair of ghostly hands that take control of the steering wheel or handlebar or cars or motorbikes, forcing them off the road.\nMore information about The Hairy Hands Legend The Hairy Hands - Legendary Dartmoor Article The Hairy Hands - a British Film Institution film from 1965 by David Mudd Note from Simon: My mother once drove this road alone at night in the 1980s and swears she saw a coffin lying in her path. She swerved and avoided it, but didn\u0026rsquo;t dare return to investigate. I know of no other reports of coffins on this road but the incident was very close to the ancient Lich Way of which she wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware at the time. About the Lich Way Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Lich Way is a 17 mile path across Dartmoor from beyond Bellever through to Lydford. We join it on our way to the Powdermills for only a short distance, but it\u0026rsquo;s a very interesting piece of Ancient Dartmoor history. Prior to 1260, residents of the farms and villages in this area of Dartmoor belonged to the Parish of Lydford. This meant that as well as travelling off the moor to attend services, they were expected to bury their dead in the consecrated ground of Lydford, then a major and powerful town. Coffins were carried by ox or pony cart, strapped directly onto pack ponies, or carried by men. The route bears many memories of its purpose. There is a Coffin Wood, and many suitable large flat rocks along the route are identified as \u0026ldquo;Coffin Stones\u0026rdquo; where the heavy burden was laid so the carriers could rest. Lich or Lych? Both methods of spelling are in wide usage, both on Dartmoor and elsewhere. The word is thought to be derived from the German \u0026ldquo;leich\u0026rdquo; or Dutch \u0026ldquo;lijk\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;Corpse\u0026rdquo;, so perhaps Lich is the more correct. For more information about the Lich way, please see the excellent article on Legendary Dartmoor Arch Tor Arch Tor: The top stone is a large logan stone, with rock basins and an inscription that reads \u0026ldquo;PC\u0026rdquo; that has been suggested to refer to Powdermills Cottages. We\u0026rsquo;ll take a closer look on the walk back.\nAbout Gunpowder Gunpowder is a mixture of three components of varying proportions depending on intended use.\nMore info - Wikipedia\nHowever, the production of gunpowder is complicated and is unsurprisingly dangerous.\nThe Powdermills site is also complicated. Everything (except for the water) entered the site at the Southern entrance. Various stages in production occurred going up through the site to the three incorporation mills at the north end and then coming back down through the site until final storage in a main magazine ready for shipment to buyers.\nGunpowder, black powder or rock powder (local name) used for quarrying and mine blasting, is still used in fireworks.\nThe composition is 75% saltpetre, 15% charcoal and 10% sulphur (aka brimstone or burning stone).\nDynamite, more powerful, was patented in May 1867 by Alfred Nobel. Its success as a superior explosive led to eventual closure of the mills in 1897.\nThe ingredients, saltpetre (mostly from India), sulphur (mostly from the Vesuvius and Stromboli regions of Italy) and the charcoal (made from local wood, especially alder or alder buckthorn), were ground separately in a grinding mill house. These were then blended in the required proportions in large barrels tumbled by waterwheels. This incorporated them into a single compound using a combination of mixing, crushing and churning. This was a hazardous process that was governed by strict regulations and regular inspections. Only wooden and copper tools were allowed , so as to prevent sparks causing explosions. The men had to wear leather aprons and sof-soled shoes, no hobnail boots. There is a story that one man, Silas Sleep, who took his breakfast and dinner to eat at work, always ate them both together, in case he was \u0026lsquo;blowed up\u0026rsquo; and sent to meet his maker before lunch time.\n\u0026ldquo;Incorporation\u0026rdquo; was the first stage of production, in one of the three incorporation mills (\u0026ldquo;wheelhouses\u0026rdquo;) at the top of the site, it resulted in a form of \u0026ldquo;cake\u0026rdquo;. It was probably at this stage that the powders were dampened with water to reduce \u0026ldquo;dust\u0026rdquo; and prevent accidental explosions. This also helped the very soluble salpetre to mix into the porous charcoal. The resulting damp paste or \u0026ldquo;mill cake\u0026rdquo; was shaped into \u0026ldquo;corns\u0026rdquo;.\nThis was \u0026ldquo;ripe charge\u0026rdquo; that could be stored for a short period. It was then pressed down in e.g. a 2-ft square box to \u0026ldquo;press cake\u0026rdquo; about an inch thick. Originally this was a hand-powered process, like a cider press, but later a water wheel was used to drive the presses.\nThe next stage was \u0026ldquo;corning\u0026rdquo; when slabs of cake were broken up with wooden mallets into a granular form. Later, water-powered machines were used. This involved rollers and then sieving through different sized meshes. The powder was then tumbled in rotating barrels or cylinders. These were covered with gauze to collect any small dust-sized particles. This was another water-wheel powered process.\nThe next stage was \u0026ldquo;glazing\u0026rdquo;, where the grains were tumbled again, with graphite or black lead to give each grain of powder a waterproof coating. This made the powder suitabe for use in damp mines and quarrying.\nThe last stage was \u0026ldquo;drying\u0026rdquo;, sometimes in the open air. Usually, this was done in heated \u0026ldquo;Gloom stoves\u0026rdquo;. These were heated by an iron furnace with the powder laid on trays stacked around it. Later, steam stoves were used to heat pipes near the trays. The process used a flue to take away any sparks and fumes to a chimney - and this is seen at the south, bottom end of the site.\nThe final product was packed in large oak barrels that were covered with leather to prevent spillage and from stray sparks entering.\nThe gunpowder quality was tested periodically using the proving mortar that lies beside the road going into the Powdermills site. The strength was determined by firing a 68 lb iron ball over a distance that was then measured.\nBesides the actual gunpowder makers or millers, the Powdermills employed coopers, blacksmiths, carpenters, wagoneers, carters, wheelwrights, stable staff and labourers.\nThe Powdermills History George Frean, a Plymouth Alderman, founded the Plymouth \u0026amp; Dartmoor Gunpowder Company and opened Powdermills in 1844; it closed in 1897. It had employed about 100 men.\nGeorge Frean later teamed up with James Peek, one of three brothers importing tea - wanted a biscuit business for \u0026ldquo;tea and biscuits\u0026rdquo; - wrote to George Frean, \u0026ldquo;miller and ships biscuit maker\u0026rdquo;, who had married a niece of theirs, to manage Peak Freans\nThe whole complex was powered by water which was brought in by three leats. Initially, one leat came from the east bank of the Cherry Brook to a rectangular reservoir north of the three isolated incorporating mills. The water then returned to the Cherry Brook. The second leat came from the west side of the Cherry Brook to a circular reservoir behind the buildings. Water was taken for four years without Duchy permission. Permission was quickly granted because the Prince Consort, Prince Albert, had encouraged the venture. Later, water was also leated from the East Dart River to the north end reservoir. The water was then leated to water wheels used for grinding and powering other machinery.\nThe leat through the site is described in the book Industrial Archaeology of Dartmoor as now being dry and \u0026ldquo;two points at which it crosses the Cherry Brook, which flows between the buildings, can be seen. At one of these points, after feeding half the wheelhouses, the leat passes under the Cherry Brook through a wooden launder, which is still in place, in hard and excellent condition in spite of its years of saturation. Further downstream the leat\u0026rsquo;s channel back under the brook is of stone, big enough for a man to enter. The water had to be conveyed some way before being allowed to discharge, in order to prevent pollution of the Cherry Brook\u0026rdquo;.\nWaterwheels were used in the three massively-built incorporating mills (1,2,3 on the map), glazing mill (4), pressing house (5) and two in the incorporating/composition mill and cartridge pressing house/corning/dusting house and glazing mill complex (6,7), and the final preparation rooms (8), making eight altogether. There is also a ninth, disused wheelpit at the final preparation rooms with later lean-tos in it.\nSeparate from the powder works to the south, along the road in, is the row of 19th century buildings that included cottages, a manager\u0026rsquo;s house, school, cooperage and a small Methodist chapel. Today, there is a pottery, offices and farm buildings. South of the cottages beside the road is the proving mortar and nearby is a wheel-binding stone, used for fixing hot iron rims to cart and wagon wheels.\nLink to Heritage Gateway for one of the many Monuments on this site - see \u0026ldquo;Associated Monuments\u0026rdquo;\nThe Powdermills Site The site - starting below at South Chimney after entering at the top of the site.\nThere can be confusion identifying buildings when referring to the 2019 book and the 1990 survey listed above. The book starts at the south end of the site (page 98) with \u0026ldquo;Building 1\u0026rdquo; and the archaeogical survey starts from the north. The survey numbers are in (brackets).\nThere is no known map saying what each building was used for, so there is conjecture based on the gunpowder-making processes and the requirements for them to be carried out.\nAround the South Chimney If ready-made charcoal was brought in, then the South Chimney could have been for processing saltpetre, dissolving it and recrystallising it to make it more pure.\nThree phases of development and extension have been identified and it is likely that the function of the buildings changed over time. A flue and chimney indicate heat was involved. The flue to the chimney is about 1 metre deep and 1 metre wide. Its eastern portion is now open and rubble-filled, but the western portion is still capped. It enters the base of the chimney which is set on a plinth. The chimney is about 10.5 metres high.\nSouth Chimney with the 17 (18) Saltpetre / Charcoal Works behind. Across the track is the 2 (17) Cartridge Press House / Watch House / Store and up the slope behind that is the 1 (16) Watch House / Checking House. At the left edge are the roofs of the Powdermills Cottages, Pottery / Cafe, and offices.\nLeaving the chimney Immediately ahead is 3 (15) a Mixing House / Store behind the gate and tree, and to the right is 4 (14), a double structure that had two water wheels. The left section is believed to be a Cartridge Press House / Preparation Room and the right section is believed to be the Corning / Dusting House and Glazing Mill.\nPossibly a saltpetre crystallising house.\nLong rectangular single-storey building located at the southern end of the site and aligned north to south.. Two, possibly three, phases have been identified. Water was culverted through the building under the floor. Its north wall was probably the dwarf wall which now subdivides it from the extension to the north. Dwarf walls in one interior consist of one long spine wall and two side walls. Another dwarf wall runs east to west across the structure from the northernmost door to the east wall. These appear to form a raised floor with water, air or heat circulating beneath. A small, square, stone-lined feature to the west of the south-west corner may be a well, or possibly a pit in which staves were soaked. The building is described in the book as the Watch House, where materials in and out of the site were monitored. It might also have been used as a store.\nHidden behind is 3 (15) Mixing House / Store and to the right is 4 (14), a double structure that had two water wheels. The left section is believed to be a Cartridge Press House / Preparation Room and the right section is believed to be the Corning / Dusting House and Glazing Mill.\nSmall, rectangular, single-storey shed, in line with the track over the brook to the South Chimney. Aligned north to south. South gable end mostly survives. The west wall stands to full height; the east wall survives only as footings. No doors or windows are present in the three standing walls. There is plaster rendering on the interior. Small stone-lined channel runs east to west down the outside of, and parallel to, the south wall.\nIncorporating/composition mill (south), possible cartridge press house (south of N building) and possible corning/dusting house/glazing mill. Consists of two pairs of structures on either side of two wheelpits. The tailrace of the southern wheepit discharges back to the Cherrybrook. The wheel between the southern mill was powered by a continuation of the leat powering buildings to the north. The wheelpit tailrace discharged via a channel into Cherry Brook. The culvert has an arched roof of granite blocks overlain by slabs.\nLong, rectangular gable-ended(?) building aligned north-south with an east-west wheelpit to the south. The wall of the wheelpit is visible only in the west. The position of the sluice is identifiable. The tailrace is not visible. This where a waterwheel powered a press to squeeze moisture out of the gunpowder.\nSmall building, aligned north to south just south of the glazing mill (below). There is a large rectangular stone table, 20-25 centimetres thick, on a masonry base.The table top is smooth. On this, the slabs of pressed gunpowder were broken down.\nLong rectangular building, aligned north / south. The structure contains supports for a raised floor, or to support machinery such as glazing barrels. The internal supports may alternatively have been to provide under-floor ventilation. There is a wheelpit at the south end of the building. This where \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; pieces of gunpowder from the Breaking House were sieved and large pieces were returned to the Breaking House and fine powder was returned to the Press House.\nThere is a Circular Reservoir on the hill above between this building and the preceding building.\nPossibly where \u0026ldquo;corns\u0026rdquo; i.e. sieved gunpowder was stored. This facing the track coming down the hill from the three incorporation mills - note the fingerboard signpost.\nIt is probable that these buildings were used for dusting, glazing, sieving and packing the gunpowder prior to carting it it off-site. Horses may have been stabled here as well as barrels and other materials being stored here. There are two mills powered by a waterwheel.\n\u0026lsquo;Gloom\u0026rsquo; or steam stone used for drying gunpowder. A portion of the west wall of \u0026ldquo;Unit D\u0026rdquo; (in the survey) remains, in the centre of which is a flue leading to the chimney 5-6 metres to the south-west. Two wheel cogs lie at the east end of the building, but may not be in situ.\nSimilar in plan to \u0026lsquo;Buildings 1 and 2\u0026rsquo;, consisting of two units flanking a central wheelpit. The wheelpit is largely filled with rubble. The wheel was powered by water from the tailrace of the wheelpit of \u0026lsquo;Building 2\u0026rsquo;. The three incorporating mill houses (\u0026ldquo;wheelhouses\u0026rdquo;) were of massive construction with many granite blocks being 6-feet long and the was about 6-feet thick, to withstand inadvertent explosions. The roofs were very flimsy, of wood and tar, to blow off without damaging the main structure. They could be replaced easily.\nTar drips indicate that either it was not gable ended, or the gable ends were constructed of timber of lesser width than the walls below. Water outflow continues west in the form of a leat, towards \u0026lsquo;Building 3\u0026rsquo;.\nBackground: 5 (1) Incorporating Mill: Consists of a pair of gable-ended structures flanking a large central wheelpit. Both of massive granite blocks with walls about 2 metres thick at their bases.\nTar dribbles indicate original roofing was of tarred tarpaulin or wood. This was probably to allow any accidental explosion to go upwards and leave the walls standing, a technique still used by artisinal powder makers in India and China today.\nThe wheelpit is aligned north-east to south-west and runs the whole width of the units. Wheel axle appears to have projected into their ground floors. Powered by a launder to the north-east which flowed out through a culvert to the south-west. This is roofed for 3.5 - 4 metres, then becomes an open channel which runs downhill to feed the reservoir belonging to \u0026lsquo;Building 2\u0026rsquo;.\nThe raised bank at the left brought the leat that fed a launder to the waterwheel.\nArch Tor An \u0026ldquo;extra\u0026rdquo; to the walk: exit the site via the gate at the top right corner, past the Incorporation Mills, and walk out straight to Arch Tor. The whole top stone \u0026ldquo;logs\u0026rdquo; i.e. rocks, as a logan stone.\nExtra bits This proving mortar is just off the road, on the left, on the last bend when driving in approaching the Pottery, cafe and mill cottages.\nIt fired a (probably) 68 lb ball to test the powder. The distance travelled by the ball was a measure of the strength of the powder and undoubtedly a good sales tactic for potential buyers.\nThis walk was reached from a small roadside layby marked by the yellow cross below the \u0026ldquo;Lich Way Plaque\u0026rdquo; label on the map. Normally, for a group, it would be reached from the main car park in Postbridge or the car park in the forest just across the road from it.

The mine entrance is hidden in the slope, between the two stumps.\nThe Fougou (Cave) Note the granite slabs forming the roof, making this a man-made cave (for tools) rather than the more usual potato cave. Potato caves are normally dug into growan (\u0026ldquo;rotted\u0026rdquo; granite). In this photograph, there is water in the fougou. The dimensions are 11-feet deep, 3-feet wide, 4-feet high, with the entrance being just 2-feet high (Hemery, High Dartmoor, p.124). There is a traditional potato cave just 50 metres away on the track below Leathertor Farm.\nHeritage Gateway Article for this fougou\nLeathertor Farm Leathertor Farm is first recorded in Bailiff\u0026rsquo;s Accounts for the Manor of Dartmoor in 1362, regarding the renting of land at Leddertorre. Later, in 1511, more detailed reports were made. The last tenant was William Lillicrap who abandoned the farm in 1924. Some occupants were also tinners.\nSource: Paul Rendell (2007) Exploring Around Burrator, The Dartmoor Company, Okehampton, pages 20 and 55.

Another curious stone with a round top and a piece of iron leaded into it is probably the upper stone of a crushing mill: this was never found by Hemery.\nFirst recorded 1564, abandoned by 1871 when the enclosures were incorporated into Leather Tor Farm.\nSource: Paul Rendell (2007) Exploring Around Burrator, The Dartmoor Company, pages 31 and 57 Heritage Gateway Article for Riddipit Farm\nHeritage Gateway Article for this Southern Farmbuilding\nHeritage Gateway Article for this Northern Farmbuilding\nDescribed as a blowing house, but with no trace of a leat, launder bank or wheel pit, three necessary signs for a blowing house or tin mill, therefore probably a cart shed for the farm (Hemery p.128).\nHowever, the field behind this hedge is called \u0026ldquo;Mill Park\u0026rdquo; in the tithe apportionments (Plot 930).\nAlso, the remains an old mortar stone is to be found here under the leaves and debris - but mortar stones are found widespread in the area.\nHeritage Gateway Article for this Stamping Mill\nMortar Stone Big Potato Cave RN Worth (1967) Worth\u0026rsquo;s Dartmoor, David \u0026amp; Charles, page 417, describes it as a potato cave (always dug into growan) but Eric Hemery (1983) High Dartmoor, Robert Hale, London, page 129, argues that it shows signs of corbelling (as used in beehive huts, never seen in potato caves) and is in fact a cache (or vooga / fougou) for miners\u0026rsquo; tools from the Keaglesborough (Kekelles Burrowghe) Tin Mine.\nHeritage Gateway Article for this potato cave\nKeaglesborough Mine The earliest reference to tinworking on this site is in a deed from 1538, where it is called Kekylsburgh.

An Openwork in the nearby Newleycombe valley (Kingsett Gert) was first mentioned in 1505 (then, a long time in dispute), with a later date of 1639 (i.e. more than 140 years working). Ref. Phil Newman (1998), The Dartmoor Tin Industry - A Field Guide, Chercombe Press, Newton Abbot, p.8.\nEarly tin workings, while being a large industry in medieval times, finally ceased production by 1750 (Newman, Ibid, p.55).\nIn the late 1700s and 1800s, workings started going underground - with drainage effected by adits, horizontal tunnels driven into hillsides to let water run out of the workings e.g. Keaglesborough and Eylesborough.\nThere are two \u0026ldquo;dressing floors\u0026rdquo; on this site, these being areas where mined rock is treated to concentrate the tin by crushing (under iron \u0026ldquo;stamps\u0026rdquo; falling againt mortar stones) to separate the tin-bearing rock from other rock of no value. The end of the leat that powered the waterwheel is probably the raised grassy area seen towards the top right in the photograph \u0026hellip;..\nThis wheel was operating in 1801; length of wheelpit - 6.2 metres (20 feet) with a double-sided dressing floor, rectangular buddles.

Thus, over this 24 years, this would have been 5,357 tons. If a mould stone produced ingots that weighed about 1 cwt then this means 107,143 ingots were produced. It is believed that not all tin was presented for coinage and taxation.\nSource: Interpretation of data in: Tom Greeves (2017),The World of the Dartmoor Tinner: An Historical Context 12th to 20th Century.

But then, all land on Dartmoor is owned by someone, whether it is Common Land or not. Hound Tor is clearly an \u0026ldquo;avenue tor\u0026rdquo;, where the central portion has been eroded to leave a central avenue running between the remaining piles - other examples are Bellever Tor, Haytor, Rippon Tor and Pew Tor. In fact, there are several avenues through Hound Tor.\nThe road through Swallerton Gate leads to Swine Down and, further on, to Kitty Jay\u0026rsquo;s grave. An old gate post can be seen on the left (see next photograph). Beyond, there is a cottage on the left, Swallerton Gate, formerly the Hound Tor Inn until 1840 and thought before that to have been the Green Dragon Inn. It was recorded as Swine Down Cottage in the 1851 Census (Source: Mike Brown, 7389 7915 and 737 796).\nIt is well-situated on the road between Ashburton and Chagford - two busy market towns. It would also have been used by the inhabitants of Widecombe and Ilsington on their way to market. There is an old cross in the garden wall of the cottage. Source: Dave Brewer (2002), Dartmoor Boundary Markers, Halsgrove, p. 115.\nThere are records that Thor Heyerdahl wrote at least part of The Kon-Tiki Expedition in the cottage.\nThis cross was going to be used in the hardcore for the floor of the extension but an intervention pointed out that is was a medieval cross head. The intervention came from a passing Harry Starkey, a well-known Dartmoor guide to whom there is a memorial locally on the back of the replaced Duke Stone on the Ilsington Manor boundary at SX 74605 77305, close to Becka Brook.\nThis could be the cross formerly known as Swine Path Cross, at what is now known as Swallerton Gate, that is mentioned in a description of the boundary between Chagford and Ashburton Stannaries that dates from the last meeting of a Stannary Court in 1786 at Crockern Tor, using a \u0026ldquo;Presentiments of the Bounds of the several Stannary Courts of Devon\u0026rdquo; dated 1613 (Brewer, pp.269-273).\nAddendum: FH (Harry) Starkey (1987) Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Crosses and Some Ancient Tracks, Revised Edition, pages 155-156, records that the cross was found in a nearby hedge in 1939 and was described by EN Masson Phillips in Transactions of the Devonshire Association, Vol. LX11 (1940) page 267.\nKitty Jay It is said that the local parishes of Manaton, Widecombe-in-the-Moor and North Bovey all refused to bury poor Kitty\u0026rsquo;s body in consecrated ground because she had commited suicide. In those times this was considered to be self-murder and therefore a mortal sin.\nIt is also said that burial at crossroads was chosen possibly as a warning to others and also to confuse the spirit or ghost of the departed so that they might not easily find their way back to where they had lived and be of nuisance to the living.\nThe Burial of Suicide Act 1823 did away with the requirement for crossroads burials.\nAddendum: Devon \u0026amp; Dartmoor Historic Environment Record - MDV7489 Jay\u0026rsquo;s Grave - one report in this record (by Beeson M, 2018) mentions Ann Jay, Kay, Betty Kay, an 1882 poem referring to Kay\u0026rsquo;s Grave, and Betsy Kay. An eyewitness to the exhumation put her death to around 1780-1790.\nWho was Kitty Jay?\nHer name has been recorded as Ann Jay (1851), Kay (an old woman, 1876), Betty Kay (1881), Kitty Jay (Crossing, Guide to Dartmoor, p.295, 1912), \u0026ldquo;J\u0026rdquo; (1914), Mary Jay (1934). She has also been recorded as \u0026ldquo;Jane\u0026rdquo; as in Jane\u0026rsquo;s Grave.\nThe report by William Crossing says that on 25th January 1851, Mr. James Bryant of Hedge Barton had the grave opened after it was found by workers tidying the area. Bones were found that were confirmed by a visiting doctor to be those of a young woman. They were reburied in a wooden box and the stones were placed to form the grave as it is seen today.\nReprinting a Widecombe History Group item that was told by Beatrice Chase in the Western Morning News on 3rd March 1934:\nA Workhouse apprentice hired out by the parish to Barracott Farm, Manaton. Hanged herself in a barn at Ford Farm. A parish register that recorded Apprentices 1804-1840 contained the name of Mary Jay among them, as well as the names of witnesses, overseer and assenting magistrate.\nThe father of Mr Robert Nosworthy, born at Ford \u0026ldquo;exactly one hundred years ago\u0026rdquo; (written in 1934, therefore born 1834), always spoke of her as Mary Jay, as did his great aunt, a generation back. Original OS maps had it labelled as Jay\u0026rsquo;s Grave but Mr John Kitson of Heatree had it changed to Jane\u0026rsquo;s Grave. His family agreed it should be reverted to Jay\u0026rsquo;s Grave (1937-1961 1:25k Series). OS 25-inch 1885/1886. The adjacent single sheet map has Swallerton Gate marked as Swinedown Gate.\nCrippon Rock Feldspar crystals indicate that the rock cooled slowly after it was formed. this example is probably plagioclase feldspar (ie of a family containing NaAlSi3O8 to CaAl2Si2O8 and usually white. The alternative would be an orthoclase feldspar (ie containing potassium KAlSi3O8 ) but those are usually pinkish in hur. In granite, quartz crystals are usually greyish and translucent. My thanks to John Viant for this information\nLogan Stone Medieval Longhouse ruins The uphill left corner of the house is marked by the hawthorn tree with the rest of the house being in the right half of the photograph - it was difficult to photograph against the sun. The orientation is as it is in the diagram below: this is described by Jeremy Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities, Vol. 1 - The East, Map 21 - 5: Blissmoor longhouse (fig. 21.3), page 155\nBowerman\u0026rsquo;s Nose The story of Bowerman is that many years ago he lived in the Manaton area and was a keen hunter.\nOne day his hounds started a hare and he gave chase. He was so keen to catch the hare that he did not notice that the hounds had led him through a coven of witches, knocking over their cauldron. They were so incensed that they decided he must be punished.\nThe next time he was out hunting, one of the witches transformed herself into a white hare - a highly prized trophy. She led him the merriest chase of his life until he was near exhaustion. Then she led him and his hounds back to this spot where the other witches were waiting.\nThey turned him into a pillar of granite as punishment, right here, where he must gaze out for all eternity on his favourite hunting lands.\nHis hounds ran in fear for their lives but the witches turned on them as well, turning them to stone on a nearby hill - which is known today as \u0026ldquo;Hound Tor\u0026rdquo;.\nHayne Down Rocks Moyle\u0026rsquo;s Gate Swallerton Rocks This walk was reached by following the \u0026ldquo;Widecombe\u0026rdquo; sign from the A38 just past Ashburton, heading towards Exeter, via Owlacombe Cross, Halshanger Cross, turn right at Cold East Cross, left at Hemsworthy Gate after passing Rippon Tor on the right.

Grazing, stone, peat - but not green oak or venison.\nThe farm was abandoned somewhere in the middle of the 1900s - the kitchen range and abandoned vehicles date from the 30\u0026rsquo;s onwards.\nTwist was put up for sale in 1934 and likely fell into dereliction relatively soon afterwards, perhaps during the second world war which drained many young men from the country.\nMore information from Dartmoor Explorations Heritage Gateway Article Note that some pictures come from Simon\u0026rsquo;s visits in 2017 and 2019\nIncomplete venville building This unassuming pile of stones is perhaps the remains of a \u0026ldquo;cottage in a day\u0026rdquo; undertaking - wherein you could live on the land if you could \u0026ldquo;build and roof a house between the house of sunrise and sunset, and have smoke coming out of its chimney\u0026rdquo;.\nIn this case, it\u0026rsquo;s said that the building was interrupted by local residents who didn\u0026rsquo;t want it there and failed the challenge.\nClapper Bridge Devon United Mine and Shaft The North mine was worked for copper until the 1850\u0026rsquo;s.
