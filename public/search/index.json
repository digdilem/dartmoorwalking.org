We then return along a low ridge to another cairn atop Water Hill, before dropping back down to the starting point. The views are impressive, and although never far from the road, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to lose sight of modernity and step back in time in one\u0026rsquo;s imagination to when this area was a thriving tin mining valley, or even further back to the bronze age when it was also busy with several nearby settlements.\nWarren House Inn This pub claims to be the most famous pub on Dartmoor and is certainly one of the most visited, especially on a Summer\u0026rsquo;s day. When the prison was working, visitors would often stop by here on their way to visit friends and relatives.\nAt 434m above sea level, it\u0026rsquo;s the highest pub in Southern England and the second highest overall. It claims to have kept its fire burning continuously since 1845, which must make for exciting work as the pub\u0026rsquo;s chimney sweep.\nOriginally named New House and built in 1751, it was then positioned on the opposite side of the road where the foundations can still be seen. In 1845, the pub was rebuilt and renamed to the \u0026ldquo;Moreton Inn\u0026rdquo; to serve the thriving tin mining industry that was literally on its doorstep, with Vitifer and Golden Dagger mines only a short distance downhill.\nShortly afterwards it was renamed to its present title for the Headland Warren that was built nearby to give the miners a steady supply of meat.\nThe sign of the tinners\u0026rsquo; three rabbits (sometimes called The Three Hares). This is often seen carved in Churches near mining areas, and usually the rabbits share only three ears between them.\nWarren House History Heritage Gateway MDV18822 - Warren House Inn Headland Warren The letters WB are difficult to see now, occupying the upper six inches on the face of the stone. This is one of a series of 15 similar stones that mark the bounds of Headland Warren, where rabbits were bred to feed the miners. Warren House Inn is named after the warren. The \u0026ldquo;15\u0026rdquo; bound stones includes the large Bennet\u0026rsquo;s Cross, which stands tall and proud to the side of the road, also marked \u0026ldquo;WB\u0026rdquo;. The stones date from around 1780 \u0026ndash; (Dave Brewer, 2002, Dartmoor Boundary Markers, pp. 265-268)\n\u0026ldquo;Benet’s Cross stands at the roadside, a tall roughly hewn cross with a distinctive bend in the shaft, inscribed on its north face the letters ‘WB’. The original purpose of the cross is uncertain — it may have been a route guide post, or a bond mark of lands owned by Buckfast Abbey, or perhaps both. The name should be spelt with a single ‘n’ and a single ‘t’ — though few people seem to do so — for it is derived from the Benedictine order of monks, indicating its former association with the original monastery at Buckfast — this was at first a Benedictine abbey, as also is the present one, but was a Cistercian monastery from the thirteenth century until the Dissolution. The cross also acted not only as a boundary marker for Headland Warren, to which the letters refer (WB = Warren Bounds), but also for the Vitifer and Birch Tor mining setts, as well as being a bond mark on the Chagford/North Bovey parish line, a purpose which it still serves today. A curious coincidence is the fact that a William Bennett was a representative of Chagford Stannary in the time of King Henry VIII, and he would have undoubtedly had some indirect connections with the earliest tin-streaming activities in the area.\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; Mike Brown (2001) Guide to Dartmoor\nCarp\u0026rsquo;n Moses Bungalow Near to our parking are the ruins of a stone-built bungalow that belonged to Cap\u0026rsquo;n Moses, once captain of the Birch Tor \u0026amp; Vitifer Mine nearby. The bungalow was also known as King\u0026rsquo;s Bungalow (after King\u0026rsquo;s Oven) and it was demolished in 1976.\nThis green cast iron item is a Telegraph Marker. There are thirteen of these items between Moretonhampstead and Tavistock. They marked the route of underground telegraph cables placed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After bad blizzards of 1891, a need was seen to create more reliable communications after overhead telegraph cables were damaged and made inoperable.\nDartefacts Telegraph Markers Map Starting our walk When ready to depart, follow the track directly off the road as seen below\nThe start of the walk is an ancient trackway to the open workings of the Water Hill Mine that has extensive diggings on this hillside. There is a large gert (A mining remain where tin was washed out of the rock) right behind the Warren House Inn that approaches from the west - this being the direction of the Caroline Mine. The Water Hill MIne workings extend rightwards in this photograph, towards Moretonhampstead, towards the workings of Bushdown Mine.\nHeritage Gateway MDV27841 - Tin Working on South Side of Water Hill Heritage Gateway MDV54593 - Vast open cut on Water Hill Tin was the prime motive for the mining of this area, specifically Casseterite.\nMindat mining and mineralogy details of this area Kings\u0026rsquo; Oven and V-Stones One of Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s mysteries, the V stones - no-one knows what these are. It has been suggested they might be for the base of machinery, the base of a flagpole, a mould and I\u0026rsquo;m sure, many other things. (See plan below for location)\nTwo theories:\nThe DTRG (Dartmoor Tinworking Research Group) Newsletter May 2020 No. 58 has a note on the \u0026ldquo;Kings Oven Stones\u0026rdquo; by Nick Walter on pages 9-10 that proposes a possible function for these stones. They could have been supports for a hand windlass that could have been used for raising loads from a small shaft in the nearby mine.\nThe next issue of the same DTRG Newsletter, dated November 2020 No. 59, has a note on the \u0026ldquo;Kings Oven Stones\u0026rdquo; by Tom Greaves on page 19. The stones may have derived from a single stone that is now broken. The cut recesses could have housed the base (wood or metal) of a flagpole. They are situated near the foundations of the larger of two ruined buildings which might have been the mine office. It is recorded that at least one mine in this area flew such a flag when they were actively working.\nKing\u0026rsquo;s Oven or Furnum Regis (in Latin). This derives from the fact that this is thought to be the site of an early smelting house, hence \u0026ldquo;oven\u0026rdquo;, the produce of which would be taxed by the King via the stannary towns, such as Chagford. Furnum Regis appears in the 1240 Perambulation of Dartmoor, although more likely mistaken for the landmark cairn at the summit of Water Hill.\nHeritage Gateway MDV6620 - Cairn and cist at King\u0026rsquo;s Oven to the east of Water Hill Heritage Gateway MDV46484 - Millstone at King\u0026rsquo;s Oven Pound Description: \u0026ldquo;The enclosure at King\u0026rsquo;s Oven is probably the site of medieval tin mining activities. Burnard comments that \u0026rsquo;the enclosure is circular and an acre in extent\u0026rsquo;. Burnard notes that the stone \u0026rsquo;looks something like the nether stone of a crazing mill\u0026rsquo;. A nether stone is the lower stone of a rotary crazing mill that was used for grinding tin ore. Crazing mills could only grind the alluvial gravels and they were replaced by stamping mills when coarser ores started being mined. In Newman\u0026rsquo;s //Dartmoor Tin Industry Field Guide// he states that only three crazing mills are known on Dartmoor at Sheepstor, Outcombe and Gobbet. Perhaps the stone photographed by Burnard in 1888 is evidence for a fourth crazing mill but the stone is no longer in situ today. King\u0026rsquo;s Oven was previously known as Furnum Regis and was mentioned by this name in a Perambulation of Henry III in 1240. However by 1609 in the Dartmoor Forestry Survey the location was known as King\u0026rsquo;s Oven.\u0026rdquo;\nThe fact that Furnum Regis, the King\u0026rsquo;s Oven (taken to imply a smelting place for tin), is a landmark in the 1240 Perambulation shows that tin was important as far back as the 1200s. The diggings in the area must date from that period - 800 years ago!\nWhen ready to leave Kings\u0026rsquo; Oven, follow the smaller path to the Northwest along the contour\nThe local name for these paths are varied and include; Pixie Path, Peat Path, Hobbit Trail, Pony Plod (from the packhorse days) or Sheepway\nHurston Ridge double stone row Heritage Gateway MDV61939 - Cairn at southern end of Stone Alignment on Hurston Ridge One of the best examples of its kind, mostly in its original state. There are 99 stones arranged in 49 pairs. There is a cairn at this upper (south-west) end, visible from the blocking stone at the lower end. Orientated NE-SW.\nLegendary Dartmoor - Hurston Stone Row Heritage Gateway MDV6541- Hurston Ridge stone row Somewhere in this area is a \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; cairn described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities. The cairn was discovered and excavated by the Dartmoor Exploration Committee in 1900 and then it was \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; again, shortly afterwards.\nDuring investigations on the cairn by Baring Gould, a \u0026ldquo;stone axe and a cinerary urn\u0026rdquo; (the latter upturned and covering a small heap of cremated bones on a flat stone, covered by a slab) were found. A photo of the restored Middle Bronze Age urn (1500-1000 BC) can be seen here (Credit: Legendary Dartmoor) The pattern around the rim is believed made by impressing the clay with a twisted cord. It was restored 1960-1962 and was put on display in the Plymouth Museum.\nWhen ready to leave the stone rows, follow the map to the Southwest, and then South to Water Hill a mile or so back towards the road\nWater Hill Cairn It is assumed that this landmark cairn, which is visible for some distance, is the \u0026ldquo;Furnum Regis\u0026rdquo; mentioned in the 1240 Perambulation of Dartmoor. This was occasioned by order of King Henry III when he granted the lands of the Forest of Dartmoor to his brother Richard. It was decreed that the Sheriff of Devon should do this accompanied by twelve knights and their attendants. Richard became an Earl in 1225 and was known as Richard of Cornwall (died 1272, aged 63)\nHeritage Gateway MDV54619 - One of two cairns on the summit of Water Hill 450 metres north-west of Warren House Inn During World War II, this cairn was covered with a temporary iron roof and used as a lookout for enemy aircraft and a potential invasion forces. It has been known as Natty\u0026rsquo;s or Nancy\u0026rsquo;s Castle, although who this was seems to be lost. This is the flat stone where King Arthur used to sit, looking west, contemplating the lands of Richard of Cornwall\nThis is a good vantage point to view the Ace Fields to the Southeast on the lower slopes of Birch Tor.\nLegend records that there are four fields, each one shaped for the suites of a pack of cards. A young tin mining wastrel, name of Jan Reynolds, dared to play cards during a church sermon. The Devil descended and bore Jan away on his large and fierce black horse, never to be seen again. As he was borne away, Jan dropped his cards, forming these enclosures. (Full story at the link below)\nLegendary Dartmoor - Jan Reynolds The less prosaic reality is that they were farming enclosures used to grow vegetables for the nearby mines.\nThe return to the road from Water Hill Cairn is now just a short stroll downhill to conclude our walk\nParking There is on-road parking close to the Warren House Inn, and several parking close to the start.\nReferences Warren House History Heritage Gateway MDV18822 - Warren House Inn Dartefacts Telegraph Markers Map Heritage Gateway MDV27841 - Tin Working on South Side of Water Hill Heritage Gateway MDV54593 - Vast open cut on Water Hill Mindat mining and mineralogy details of this area Heritage Gateway MDV6620 - Cairn and cist at King\u0026rsquo;s Oven to the east of Water Hill Heritage Gateway MDV46484 - Millstone at King\u0026rsquo;s Oven Pound Heritage Gateway MDV61939 - Cairn at southern end of Stone Alignment on Hurston Ridge Legendary Dartmoor - Hurston Stone Row Heritage Gateway MDV6541- Hurston Ridge stone row Heritage Gateway MDV54619 - One of two cairns on the summit of Water Hill 450 metres north-west of Warren House Inn Legendary Dartmoor - Jan Reynolds ","date":"2025-07-22T19:55:23+01:00","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/hurston-stone-row/26_hu_c5489cd6346c4f3d.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/hurston-stone-row/","title":"Hurston Stone Row"},{"content":"Information Distance: 3 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words rats.stick.windpipe Map Introduction This is an open walk taking in some lesser visited ancient items on its circuitous way to the much more famous Dunnabridge Pound.\nOn arrival at the car park, it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon to find it half full of Ponies. This particular herd is often a mix of Dartmoor Hill Ponies and the smaller Shetland Ponies, both ideally suited to the moor. Unfortunately, they are over-friendly due to people feeding them, which can lead to aggression from them and people being bitten is common. Please don\u0026rsquo;t feed them or otherwise encourage them.\nAs with many Dartmoor car parks, ponies will run on parked cars, especially during the moulting times of Spring and Summer when they get very itchy from their coat changing. Dents to body panels and broken mirrors are common! If you can, fold in your wing mirrors when parking on the moor.\nHeading off Once parked, head off away to the Northeast, directly away from the road.\nThis walk is mostly based off the map and route rather than detailed instructions, so please pay it close attention. The photos should be recognisable as you follow the route\nCommon Heather or Ling (Calluna vulgaris) Dartmoor Ponies A brief note about Dartmoor Ponies by Simon\nThe above mare (photo taken in 2009) is likely a Registered Dartmoor Pony as it looks to be very close to the breed standard. Every pony on Dartmoor is owned by someone with a set number of grazing rights allowing them to use certain parts of the moor for this purpose. This is governed by the Dartmoor Commoners Council\nSome owners take great pride in their herds and breed to improve certain strains, and ponies can be split into roughly four types;\nRegistered Dartmoors: These are pedigree ponies that are Registered with the Dartmoor Pony Society and must adhere to certain breed standards including colour and must be \u0026ldquo;Bay, brown, black, grey, chestnut, roan. Piebalds, Skewbalds and Spotted are not allowed.\u0026rdquo; Shetland Ponies: A common choice. Once prized for use in the many mines of Devon and Cornwall, these incredibly strong and hardy ponies adapt well to Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s harsh conditions. Dartmoor Hill Ponies: This is a loose term to describe ponies that are not registered with the DPS but are similar in shape. They can be any colour - Skewbald, Piebald, Spotty and all variations are common. Others. From time to time, owners will graze other equines. These can be horses of any shape, and the commons framework allows for Donkeys, although I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen one grazing loose. Dartmoor Commoners Council Dartmoor Pony Society Dunnabridge Pound We\u0026rsquo;ve now nearing the famous Dunnabridge Pound\nDunnabridge Pound is one example of a pound where livestock was rounded-up so that owners could reclaim their animals before a time limit. \u0026ldquo;Illegal\u0026rdquo; animals were impounded and fines levied where the owner could be found. These were animals over the numerical limits for the size of a farm, they were only allowed to keep the number of animals that the farm could support over the winter.\nUnclaimed animals were sold off to the highest bidder. One can imagine that if the fine were too large, the owner might stay quiet and buy their \u0026ldquo;illegal\u0026rdquo; animal back at the end, at the risk of being outbid for it.\nOne might be forgiven that this rather grand structure was built for this purpose, but the probable truth is that it was actually the Judge\u0026rsquo;s chair for the Tinner\u0026rsquo;s council and was taken from nearby Crockern Tor where the Stannary Parliament met. If that is true, then it truly is a Judge\u0026rsquo;s chair, as sentence was passed at Crockern Tor for anyone who broke the very strict Stannary Laws.\nLegendary Dartmoor - Dunnabridge Pound *Once you ready, follow the road over the River and back to the Car Park.\nParking There is large, free and well maintained parking at the coordinates.\nReferences These pictures were taken by Keith Ryan in 2009\nCommon Heather or Ling (Calluna vulgaris) Dartmoor Commoners Council Dartmoor Pony Society Legendary Dartmoor - Dunnabridge Pound ","date":"2025-07-12T09:55:01+01:00","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/dunnabridge-pound/18_hu_58a85fd100e73e29.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/dunnabridge-pound/","title":"Dunnabridge Pound"},{"content":"Information Distance: 4 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and Simon Avery and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words disprove.heaven.plodding Map Introduction Down Ridge near to Hexworthy is a quiet area that doesn\u0026rsquo;t get too many tourists even when other parts of the moor are busy. I\u0026rsquo;ve personally spent 8 hours walking a large loop around here without seeing a single person - a rare thing even on Dartmoor.\nThis is a walk that involves a fairly gentle slope upwards, following an old mining track and taking in some notable features. We pass a once imposing building which was used as target practice in the 1940s by the US forces training for D-Day, the wonderfully named Hooten Wheals mine close to the Henroost, both once profitable tin mines. There are also Bronze age remains nearby - all worth investigating.\nA small detour is offered to explore Hooten Wheals.\nParking There is a smallish parking area close to the given coordinates. Please be considerate to traffic continuing along the road to Sherberton.\nOnce ready to start, follow the road back the way you came from for about 600 meters, passing the first moor gateway until you come to the junction with the Hexworthy - Holne road. To your right is a gateway leading up an old track. Go through here onto the open moor\nThis was the main track leading to several mines in this area, taking supplies and workers to, and ore and tiredness back towards the welcoming fire of The Forest Inn, Hexworthy.\nTo the East and Southwest - but not visible from the track, there are a lot of Bronze age remains of hut circles, and medieval field systems.\nAfter following the track for about 1.2km, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a stone cross a short distance below it. This is Horse Ford Cross\nHorse Ford Cross This cross is one of a number that marks the route of the Monks\u0026rsquo; Path, an ancient track that links Buckfast Abbey with those at Tavistock and Buckland This path takes a more Northerly route than the more commonly known Abbots\u0026rsquo; Way, and is also known as the Maltern Way or Jobbers\u0026rsquo; Path Horse Ford Cross has been lost and discovered. At one time it disappeared entirely and wasn\u0026rsquo;t seen for many years when in 1884 a local labourer discovered it buried in heather and turf. It was subsequently repaired with the iron strap and re-erected at its current location, although it\u0026rsquo;s much shorter than it was originally It stands 1.05m (3'5\u0026quot; high and 0.67m (2'2\u0026quot;) across the arms There are many references to Horses across Dartmoor, giving reference to their importance in day to day life Horse Ford itself is directly below the Cross, providing a crossing of the O Brook. A short way along the track, next to it on the upper side is\u0026hellip;\nMine Office This was probably a fairly small building, positioned closely to the track so that incoming stores and workers could be closely monitored - and perhaps measuring tin that left the site. It\u0026rsquo;s thought that as well as being the site office, the mine captain lived here, away from the main body of men.\nFurther along the track you\u0026rsquo;ll come across more ruins\nThe Barracks Locally known as the Barracks, this once large building was also known as \u0026ldquo;The Dry\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The Shop\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Dorm\u0026rdquo;. Also, more lately, and perhaps only by myself, \u0026ldquo;The Shooting Range\u0026rdquo;\nThe Barracks were built in 1907 and were multi-use:\nThey were used as a Miner\u0026rsquo;s dry - a place to dry out wet clothing and boots Also a dormitory for miners to sleep. Commonly during this time, beds were multi-occupancy, with \u0026ldquo;shifts\u0026rdquo; taken, or \u0026ldquo;top and tail\u0026rdquo; sleeping arrangements when there wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough room There is also evidence of machinery being housed in this building, with large bases It\u0026rsquo;s known that there was a Blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s shop either in or attached to this building - an essential part of any working mine The building measures approximately 14 by 6 meters and would have been two storeys high, made of local stone mortared and rendered with cement\nThe Barracks was used as a target by American Troops stationed nearby during 1943/44, as preparation for the D-Day landings. A large number of bullet holes can still be seen in the render, and indeed, on some ancient crosses in the area. Artillery was also used to reduce it to the state it is today.\nHeritage Gateway MDV6389 - Hooten Wheals / Hexworthy Tin Mine\nThere is much evidence of various diggings in pursuit of the ore seams visible from this location in all directions. For example, the very straight track heading exactly due East just before the barracks leads to a now collapsed adit.\nO Brook Clapper Bridges Flat rods were simply flat rods of iron that were connected to the water wheel. They converted the rotary motion of the wheel to a reciprocating back and forth action through the rods, which rested on low granite blocks placed at set distances, usually with well greased rollers. These rods were very effective at transferring power around the sites of mines and very little was lost even over long distances.\nThese gerts predate the more modern workings and were made by \u0026ldquo;The old men\u0026rdquo; of the 17th and 18th century, or even before. The cut is caused when streaming tin lodes by directing water down them to wash out the ore.\nHooten Wheals At the Clapper bridges, you can take a short detour along the well defined path left to the Southeast to explore the working platforms and above them, the collapsed adits and shafts. Sadly I have lost my photos of these\nHooten Wheals was a highly industrialised area in the past, with a 45\u0026rsquo; (13.7m) water wheel providing power to 12 Cornish Stamps and 16 Californian Stamps to crush the ore bearing rock into smaller pieces. These stamps were positioned on the flat concrete stepped areas, using gravity to feed materials and water to help the process. This area was also roofed with corrugated iron, which was removed along with the stamps and other machiner when the mine closed. Stamps are fearsomely noisy things, just simply large chunks of iron being lifted and dropped back down repeatedly to break the stone. Combined with vibrating chutes to feed ore in and out, it would have been heard a long distance away Naming: \u0026ldquo;Hooten\u0026rdquo; originates from Old English language and means \u0026ldquo;Heel or spur of land\u0026rdquo;, referring to a ridge or piece of high ground. Indeed, contour lines do show that Skir Hill above the workings is a projection. An alternative theory is that Hooten can also mean an old farmstead, and perhaps one of the nearby farms once shared its name to the mine \u0026ldquo;Wheal\u0026rdquo; is used throughout Devon and Cornwall to name mines. It originates from \u0026ldquo;hwel\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;huel\u0026rdquo;, which is Cornish for \u0026ldquo;Work\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;place of work\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;workings\u0026rdquo; Also known as Hexworthy mine, it was active through the 19th and early 20th centuries. A licence to mine was first granted in 1845 with further licences issued in 1849 and 1854 Around 50 men were full employed by 1891 The mine closed in 1919, probably due to a shortage of labour as men were drafted to the First World War - a common reason for closure of many mines in England and Wales Pumping of the mines continued through to 1920 when a \u0026ldquo;Fearsome storm\u0026rdquo; destroyed the launder feeding water to the wheel. This also led to the collapse of the main shaft, perhaps by water entering from the broken launder combined with the lack of pumping causing the sides to soften Once done exploring Hooten Wheals, return here and follow the Northwest path alongside the Brook\nHensroost Hensroost is the name of an initially separate mine with a deep shaft called \u0026ldquo;Taylor\u0026rsquo;s Shaft\u0026rdquo; at SX 651710 plus several other collapsed shafts As with Hooten Wheals, the object of the work was to recover and partially refine tin from it\u0026rsquo;s ore, cassiterite, which is often found in seams amongst granite Towards the end of its life, Hensroost was consolidated with Hooten Wheals and both were worked together, with Hooten processing the ore Staying fairly close to the O Brook, follow it in a Northwesterly direction until you come to\u0026hellip;\nSkir Ford The cross was part of the Monks\u0026rsquo; Path and remains a useful indicator to find this rather nondescript, but useful fording point.\nAbout 1km upstream of the ford, there are more old tin workings and gerts from old streaming.\nTo complete our walk, head North from Skir Ford across a pretty featureless area of moorland, aiming for the gap between the stone walls about 1km away. These will funnel you to a moorgate onto the road, close to the parking area\nWe hope you enjoyed your walk.\n","date":"2025-05-11T18:32:04+01:00","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/the-henroost-and-skir-ford/6_hu_ddf91781dedf99a8.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/the-henroost-and-skir-ford/","title":"The Henroost and Skir Ford"},{"content":"Information Distance: 5 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words slowly.seats.impressed Map Introduction This walk takes us up along a ridge taking in several tors, including one that was very important for the old Tin Mining Stannary laws. Then it drops into the West Dart River, exploring some Bronze Age Hut Circles and then back past Wistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood and down the valley back to the start.\nPlease note: In accordance with Dartmoor National Park\u0026rsquo;s guidance, please do not enter Wistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood itself, or disturb it in any way. Sadly, due to huge numbers of visitors over recent years, significant damage has been caused even by those simply walking through it as well as those removing moss, branches or littering.\nIf you just want to visit Wistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood, you can follow the path up from the given parking coordinates. This shortens the walk to about a mile each way and is a pleasant easy walk, although not accessible to wheelchairs. Jump to Wistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood\nParking Quarry Before we leave our parking space, take a moment to look at the sides of the quarry.\nThis place is known as \u0026ldquo;Two Bridges Tor\u0026rdquo; as there is a distinct granite formation at the back which helps show how Tors on Dartmoor were formed, even when the Tor is underground. Rain water, being slightly acidic, soaks into the ground and rots the rock, primarily at cracks and weaknesses to form horizontal and vertical joints. Over a long period of time, the harder rock is left behind as the rest is changed into growan (Decomposed granite) and sand.\nWe see this here as this quarry was dug to provide sand and gravel for road building.\nOnce exposed to the atmosphere, then weathering continues the early work of underground decay with with, rain and the freeze/thaw action of the winter to further attack the rock.\nSource: Ken Ringwood, Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Tor and Rocks There seems to be a well repeated rumour that I\u0026rsquo;ve heard from several people who are insistent that Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Tors were once volcanos. Sadly, this is completely untrue!\nWhen ready, walk North through the gate and immediately leave it, turning uphill to your right, striking out across open moor to the North East towards a gateway in the wall about 350m away\nOnce through the gate, turn right and head to Crockern Tor\nCrockern Tor and the Stannary Parliament Crockern Tor. SX 61560 75778. Elevation 400 meters (1312 feet) This imposing rock was chosen as the meeting place of Great Court of Devon Tinners dating from around at least 1300AD and possibly as far back as 1100. The court would meet here and establish tin laws, mete out punishments for breaches, pay taxes and distribute earnings.\nThere was also an impressive Chair made of slabs of granite with a tall back and overhang placed here by a granite table for court proceedings. The chair was moved to Dunnabridge Pound by a Mr Leaman using \u0026ldquo;12 yoke of oxen\u0026rdquo; - a team of 24 beasts - and it can be seen there today, just a few miles away.\nParliament Rock itself has a natural shelf which was used as a \u0026ldquo;Court Cryer\u0026rsquo;s Chair\u0026rdquo; - presumably to shout for order and repeat the findings of the court to the wider audience.\n\u0026ldquo;Stannary\u0026rdquo; comes from the latin name for tin, Stannum. It also gives it its periodic definition, \u0026lsquo;Sn\u0026rsquo; Before the fourth century, \u0026ldquo;Tin\u0026rdquo; was used to describe any alloy of silver and lead, rather than the metal Tin. Between 1100 and 1650 AD, some 26,000 tons of smelted, white tin were extracted from Dartmoor. The most productive year was 1524 AD, when 252 tons of white tin were produced. The Stannary Court had considerable power and influence and controlled the metal mining industry of Dartmoor. The four main Tin Towns of the area were Ashburton, Chagford, Plympton and Tavistock. This site was likely chosen due to its central position between them. There is an oval area below the Court which may have housed an audience of 80-100 people.

There are over 30 mounds comprising the warre in this area, some barely noticable in the tussocky grass.\nSadly, these mounds they don\u0026rsquo;t photograph well, and just appear as lumpy brown areas.\nPillow Mounds Pillow Mounds are man made rabbit warrens dating from at least the medieval period.\nTheir name comes from the pillow shape of the mounds.\nThey were used to breed rabbits (Also known as Conies) for meat and fur. Rabbit was a mainstay of the local tin miners and was sometimes the only meat they would regularly eat.\nRabbit farming like this was done throughout Britain, and you can find many references to \u0026ldquo;Warren\u0026rdquo; in place names that persist today.\nHeritage Gateway MDV14156 - Rabbit Warren\nWalk down the hill to the West to Wistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood and, skirting the trees, continue North to the Buller Stone\nBuller Stone The Buller Stone is a distinctive triangle shaped rock some seven or eight feet tall at the Eastern edge of Wistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood, and has an inscription carved upon it dating from 1868.\nThe inscription reads:\nBY PERMISSION OF H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES WENTWORTH BULLER ON SEPT. 16TH 1868 CUT DOWN A TREE NEAR THIS SPOT IT MEASURED 9 IN IN DIAMETER AND APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 163 YEARS OLD You can continue walking up the valley for about 400m to a small copse as marked on our map.

There are known to be well over one hundred of them in the vicinity of Wistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood, so this was clearly a very busy place four thousand or so years ago.\nWistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood More skilled photographers have done some beautiful photography of Wistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood. Sadly we are not so adept. All photos from within the Woods were taken before the DNP request not to enter them.\nWistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood is a temperate rainforest, a nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) The wood is home to the incredibly rare Horsehair lichen (Bryoria smithii) which is found at only two sites in Britain. Altogether a remarkable place, said by early antiquaries to be the home of the druids, supposing Wistman to be a corruption of “wise man”. But, quite aside from the reality that there is no evidence whatsoever to associate these white-bearded priests with Dartmoor, this supposed derivation of the name is incorrect. There are two more plausible explanations for the name, either that it is derived from Welshman’s Wood, “Welsh” or “Wealas” being the Saxon word for “foreigners”, or that it comes from the Devon word “wisht” meaning “haunted”. \u0026ndash;Mike Brown (2001), Guide to Dartmoor\nThe Trees are mostly Pendunculate (or English) Oak Quercus Robur and known to be hundreds of years old, and some Rowan Sorbus Aucuparia mixed in. Shaped by the climate, weather and ground conditions almost unique to this location, they have naturally grown dwarfed. Few of the trees grow to more than 4.5 meters tall, with none more than 7m. Pendunculate Oak in other locations can reach 40 meters in height. The name of Wistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood may derive from the dialect word \u0026ldquo;wisht\u0026rdquo;, meaning \u0026ldquo;eerie/uncanny\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;pixie-led/haunted\u0026rdquo;. The legendary Wild Hunt in Devon, whose hellhounds are known as Yeth (Heath) or Wisht Hounds in the Devonshire dialect, is particularly associated with Wistman\u0026rsquo;s Wood. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was inspired by the Wild Hunt to write The Hound of the Baskervilles.

The inn bore the name of The Saracen\u0026rsquo;s Head, a familiar name for pubs at the time but likely also connected to the fact that the Buller family crest was a Saracen\u0026rsquo;s head \u0026lsquo;affronte, couped, proper\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;. Source: Alex Mettler (2015, rev.edn. 2018), Air Like Champagne: A short history of the Two Bridges Hotel, Dartmoor. Published by Two Bridges Hotel..\nThe name \u0026ldquo;Two Bridges Hotel\u0026rdquo; seems to first appear after a change of landlord in May 1849 in an advertisement in the Western Morning News. In 1885, the name The Saracen\u0026rsquo;s Head Inn appeared in an advetisement to let including \u0026ldquo;that well known Inn House \u0026lsquo;The Saracen\u0026rsquo;s Head\u0026rsquo; \u0026hellip;.. with buildings, stables, sheds and appurtenanes etc\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;. The Two Bridges Inn was destroyed by fire in late May 1866, as reported in the Exeter Flying Post. The old name continued to be used for some time.\nWentworth Buller, who cut the tree in 1868, was no doubt related to Sir Francis Buller, who had built the inn by 1794, some 74 years earlier? A web page about The Bullers of Bovey Tracy mentions Capt. Thomas Wentworth Buller (1792-1852); Wentworth William Buller (1834-1883). There is a Wikipedia entry for Sir Francis Buller that includes \u0026ldquo;He also built an inn, named the Saracen\u0026rsquo;s Head after the Buller family\u0026rsquo;s crest, at Two Bridges, on a site now occupied by the Two Bridges Hotel.\u0026rdquo; This was citing: William Crossing (1902), A Hundred Years on Dartmoor, 5th edn, The Western Morning News Co.

Additionally, the given map was an accurate log of safe walking, it was several years ago and paths in mires do move around.\nWarning: DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS WALK IN THE WINTER OR AFTER HEAVY RAIN\nThis route includes crossing the Foxtor Mire. It can be dangerous even in summer, and care must be taken. There is also a river crossing of the Swincombe. Again, during winter, this can be surprisingly steep.\nYou can avoid the crossing the mire by walking around the Western edge of the Mire and rejoin us at Goldsmith\u0026rsquo;s Cross - it adds about a mile to this walk but should be accessible in all weathers\nIntroduction Few areas on Dartmoor include such a deep amount of historical, farming, religious, mining and legend as the Whiteworks area of Dartmoor. This walk takes us past mineshafts and directly across Foxtor Mire to the Goldsmith\u0026rsquo;s cross, then along to Childe\u0026rsquo;s Tomb - a burial site with a legendary tale. Then a walk up Foxtor itself, around to the ruined remains of Foxtor Farm, visits some Bronze Age Cairns, crosses a river and passes the hut circles of an ancient village on our return.\nWhiteworks Mining Whiteworks was one of Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s largest Tin mines, and possibly the longest active with records indicating work as early as 1180.\nThe name \u0026ldquo;Whiteworks\u0026rdquo; comes from kaolin, the white clay that lies in this natural bowl, formed from degraded granite. Cassiterite - Tin Ore - was found within the clay, and working it coated everything and everyone white.\nThe vast majority of visible remains of buildings and shafts are from the 19th Century when this was a very industrialised area. A Google Maps satellite view shows long lines of open cast pits, which were dug down by hand to expose a seam of ore. Later, as the easier pickings were used up, shafts and mines were dug\nMining activity gradually declined and finally ceased at Whiteworks in 1914, when the remaining men were drafted for the First World War. As with many mines on Dartmoor and throughout Britain at that time, they never reopened.\nFoxtor Mire The distinction between \u0026ldquo;Mire\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Bog\u0026rdquo; is that bogs are fed by rainfall, and mires are fed by groundwater springs.\nThe exact depth of the mire is disputed. There are stories that the Army drove a tank into it and it disappeared never to be seen again! That\u0026rsquo;s probably just a story, but it is certainly deep enough to drown a person, and the author has personally poked a stick in at least six feet over large parts of it. It will also grow and ebb depending on recent rainfall like a large sponge. Although it\u0026rsquo;s fed by springs, it\u0026rsquo;s also fed by surface water and slows the passage of water down the Swincombe valley.\nThere was a railway sleeper laid across the river to aid crossing roughly in the centre of the mire and this is marked \u0026ldquo;FB\u0026rdquo; on Ordnance Survey Maps.\nPlease be aware that the safe path across Foxtor Mire moves around each year as livestock moves around to graze. It is not possible to rely on maps or GPX tracks.\nOnce safely across the mire, you should be fairly close to Goldsmith\u0026rsquo;s cross.\nGoldsmith\u0026rsquo;s Cross This cross is named after Lt. Goldsmith R.N. who rediscovered it in 1903, after it had been lost for many years. He found it when out on his favourite walk whilst on leave from serving on HMS Imperial, then moored at Plymouth. On stopping for lunch, he happened to notice a rectangular hole cut into the large boulder on which he was sitting. Further investigation amongst the heather revealed the head and then part of the shaft. He later returned and arranged the reconstruction as you see it today.\nDartmoor Crosses - Goldsmith\u0026rsquo;s Cross Although the exact origin and date of the cross is unknown, it is thought that the cross was used to guide travellers across the mire, and indeed it is approximately where the current path.\nA short walk Northeast of Goldsmith\u0026rsquo;s cross will take you to\u0026hellip;\nFoxtor Mire Cairn and Cist (The Gold Box) Not far from Childe\u0026rsquo;s Tomb lies an ancient tomb or kistvaen which dates back to the Bronze Age, this is known as \u0026lsquo;The Gold Box\u0026rsquo; and was said to have contained treasure belonging to a long dead chieftain.\nWalking due East will take you towards Childe\u0026rsquo;s Tomb\nChilde was a wealthy Saxon lord who loved hunting. The legend says that one winter he became trapped by a violent snowstorm and was disoriented. He made the decision to kill and disembowel his horse and climbed inside the stomach cavity to take what shelter he could. However, this was insufficient and he was found frozen to death inside.\nThe first mention of the tomb was in the 1600\u0026rsquo;s but the story may be much older.\nThe stone of the tomb was robbed by workmen building the nearby Foxtor Farm in 1812.\nIn 1885, Mr Tanner of the Dartmoor Preservation Association directed the restoration of the tomb and cross as you see it today.\nLegendary Dartmoor - Childe the Hunter Head due South and climb the hill to Fox Tor\nIf you wish to avoid the climb, you can skip Fox Tor and walk North East to the ruined Foxtor Farm\nFox Tor When ready, head Northeast\nThis girt is an artificial valley dug by men searching for tin, probably in the 1700s or 1800s. They would redirect water down from the top to help wash out the granular tin which would settle in temporary dams at the bottom. Tin being heavier than the mud and soil, it would form a layer once left to settle which could be dug out.\nFoxtor Farm These ruins are possibly what\u0026rsquo;s left of Sam Parr\u0026rsquo;s house.\nSam Parr was a labourer who worked at the nearby Fox Tor Farm in the mid 1800s. He had a wife and two children who were baptised in Princetown.\nThe ruins have also been identified as a blowing house for turning tin ore into ingots - there are certainly many remains of tinworkings and several tinner\u0026rsquo;s huts nearby, and it\u0026rsquo;s possible that Sam turned it into a home.\nOn the inner face of a large flat slab in the southeast corner of the building is an inscription \u0026ldquo;IC 1753\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the early 1800s, there were efforts to \u0026ldquo;Improve\u0026rdquo; Dartmoor for agricultural purposes - led largely by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt who was responsible for much of Princetown\u0026rsquo;s growth. The farm was build with locally sourced granite, including some stone robbed from the nearby Childe\u0026rsquo;s Tomb.\nThe farm was only occupied for 50 years, with David Gray being recorded as the main occupant and farmer. It was a sheep farm, and others tried to turn a profit here through the nineteenth century. But conditions were harsh and the remote location ultimately led to it being abandoned.\nFoxtor Farm was used by Eden Phillpotts as one of the main settings of his 1904 novel The American Prisoner, and in a subsequent early \u0026ldquo;talkie\u0026rdquo; film, made in 1929.\nWikipedia - Fox tor Follow the gradient almost due North\nTer Hill Cists This incongruous item is about 10m from the following cist. It\u0026rsquo;s possibly an old test bore hole from the 1970s when there was a proposal to flood the Swincombe Valley for a new reservoir. Such bore holes were used to establish the underlying nature of soil and rocks, and for building dams, how stable and strong the resulting barrier would need to be.\nAn alternative crossing point is at Headweir Ford (Harvey map), somewhere near SX 62270 70980, where there is a path back to Whiteworks.\nDPA Stone Dartmoor Preservation Association strongly opposed the proposed flooding of this valley. In 1970, a parliamentary committee ultimately decided against the scheme.\nIn 1985, the DPA used funds from a bequest to acquire 50 acres of land to try and prevent a similar scheme in the future. These stones mark its boundary.\nDPA - Swincombe Once you\u0026rsquo;ve cross the river, there is a settlement marked on the map with several hut circles, dating from the Bronze Age. Once visited, we conclude our walk by heading back to Whiteworks over the open moor\nParking The posted coordinates are for a small parking area just where the Devonport Leat crosses under the road. Sometimes this gets full, but if so, returning a short way back towards Princetown there are several other parking areas a short distance.\nReferences Dartmoor Crosses - Goldsmith\u0026rsquo;s Cross Legendary Dartmoor - Childe the Hunter Wikipedia - Fox tor ","date":"2025-02-23T18:34:20Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/foxtor-mire-and-childes-tomb/15_hu_34d3489b65ba5f25.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/foxtor-mire-and-childes-tomb/","title":"Foxtor Mire and Childe's Tomb"},{"content":"Information Distance: 2 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words custodial.amphibian.hinted Map This circular walk takes in some great views, visits some attractive tors and points out some old quarrying history on the way down to Merrivale.\nPark at the given coordinates and when ready, follow one of the paths due North away from the road\nThis plaque may have since been vandalised, so the original wording shown above as of 2010\nWho was Rees Jeffreys?

The intention was to mark his boundary and remove any excuse from people taking stone that belonged to him.\nSource: Dave Brewer (2002), Dartmoor Boundary Stones, Halsgrove, p.251. As you leave Great Staple Tor to the Southeast, follow the granite track Southward\nSett Maker\u0026rsquo;s Banker A quarryman once stood at this point making Setts.\nSetts are granite blocks that were much used for paving roads and paths, and can still be seen in many cities, for they last a very long time.\nRough cut setts blocks be brought here, having been cut from moorstone nearby. To cut down on transport, the bankers typically set up very close by to the raw material, and their workplaces - bankers - were rough and ready; somewhere to stand or kneel and work the stone at around waist level.\nIn exposed conditions, and this certainly qualifies, they would erect shelters to keep off the worst of the rain, snow and wind. These would have been made of oilskin tarpaulin with a stick framework, probably on three sides, backed to the wind.\nThe tools were iron chisels and a hammer, with the working stone set on a bed on firm earth and granite chips, which would absorb the blows.\nIt was a hard job. As well as the obvious difficulties of weather and repetitive, physical work; the sett-maker’s hearing will have suffered and worse, many will have suffered from silicosis from breathing granite dust and died early from lung problems.\nTraditional stonemasons still work very similarly to this, but now have tungsten tipped chisels and, when working with granite, a full-face respirator system.\nWhen I worked for DNPA in the late 1980s, they often employed a traditional stonemason who would work just inside the entrance of the Works Depot in Bovey Tracey. He had a 45 gallon oil drum full of granite chips on which he’d place his work, which might be a perfectly spherical ball to sit atop a gatepost. He’d stand there all day, chipping away. Pausing every now and then to offer up a hardboard template to check his progress, or check diameter with a set of large calipers. He wore a full face respirator, with a battery pack and inlet on his belt at the back, similar to those used by industrial welders, which blew filtered air into the mask. – Simon\nThere are Bankers all around this area.\nDuke\u0026rsquo;s Folly This noticeably man made structure is known as Duke\u0026rsquo;s Folly, after William Duke who opened Merrivale Quarry in 1875. His grand plan was to build a railway across Long Ask to link with the Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway at Swell Tor Quarry, to provide an easy route out for his stone to Plymouth.\nHis Folly here is a granite embankment made up of mostly waste rock from the main quarry, but is about as far as he got before the plan was abandoned.\nMerrivale Quarry As mentioned, Merrivale Quarry was opened by William Duke 1875 and originally called \u0026ldquo;Tor Quarry\u0026rdquo; and it absorbed the existing sett-making operations carried out under the Staple Tors.\nAs well as cutting setts, Granite from the quarry was also used for Gravestones, agricultural rollers and the like. It also provided the facing for the New Scotland Yard building in London.\nThe quarry closed in 1997, spending its final years dressing imported stone from Norway.\nWikipedia: Merrivale Follow the tracks around the quarry down to the road and cross over when safe, walking a short distance downhill until you reach the leat\nGrimstone \u0026amp; Sortridge Leat This leat was built in the 1800s to carry water seven miles to the 13th Century Grimstone manor and to Sortridge Consuls Mine.\nFollow the leat along a short distance until the car park is due North, then head across the moor and road to finish our walk\nParking There is a decent sized parking area at the given coordinates.

Leaving there, we can return up the river, or detour across the Lyd by stepping stones to the abandoned 19th Century mine, Wheal Mary Emma.\nOnce parked, head off due East along a worn path for around 350 meters until you see a bench to the left.\nThe first seat, with tors behind. These are, left to right:\nArms Tor (SX 541 862, elevation 457 metres / 1499 feet) with a small \u0026ldquo;pimple\u0026rdquo; to the right of the summit - marked by the \u0026ldquo;v\u0026rdquo; - which is a part of Great Links Tor.

Widgery Cross was erected by the painter William Widgery (1822-1893) to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887.\nThe cross is constructed from 10 courses of granite blocks, capped with a rough slab, reaching 13feet in height.\nThe words \u0026ldquo;W. Widgery, Fecit, Jubilee VR\u0026rdquo; are inscribed on the eastern side of the base stone.\nLegendary Dartmoor - Widgery Cross When ready, continue Eastward along the path until you approach the River Lyd\nBuilding or Enclosure These walls are said to be a large building, although its use is unknown. It might be associated with the Wheal Mary Emma tin mine downstream, but if so, it\u0026rsquo;s an unusual structure for a mining building.\nIt does not appear in the tithe map of 1848, nor the OS 25-inch map from 1884, but does show up on the revised 1904 version. The mine was active in the 1860s so the timings are not far out if it was related.\nAlternatively, it could be a farming or warren enclosure rather than a building.\nBlack Rock Seats There are two somewhat hidden benches at Black Rock, shown here by the white circles.\nBoth seats overlook Black Pool, or Hunter\u0026rsquo;s Pool.\nThe plaque reads:\nIN LOVING MEMORY OF CAPTAIN NIGEL DUNCAN RATCLIFFE HUNTER M.C.

When ready, turn Left and follow the riverbank Northwards to High Down Ford and Bridge\nHigh Down Ford and Bridge Cross the River and turn right, following the path down on the other bank until you reach and cross the footbridge over Doe Tor Brook\nDoe Tor Bridge and Falls Doe Tor Farm Doe Tor Farm is a post-medieval farmstead dating to the mid 18th century and was abandoned around 1955 as uneconomic or uninhabitable.\nA perfect prehistoric flint scraper was found here in 2001 proving man\u0026rsquo;s presence here around 4,000 to 5,000 years ago.\nThe MOD commissioned an extensive site survey report which is linked below. It\u0026rsquo;s very recommended to read as it includes a lot of well written information and interpretation, including human interest from the people who farmed here.\nHeritage Gateway MDV103222 - Doe Tor Farm MOD Historic Site Survey (PDF) The lane is now used for penning/inspecting animals, hence the hurdles. The top left area in this picture are the ruins of the Shippon. The ruins to the top/right are the Calf House.\nThere is apparently a millstone built in the walls hereabouts, but possibly now overgrown by turf.\nThe above stone was well documented here. Flat on one side and curved on the other, to run against the outer curve of the circular trough. It was reported stolen in 2005.\nDoe Tor This trough was abandoned soon after carving started. It\u0026rsquo;s on the near slope of Doe Tor, about 125 meters from the house.\nReturn route - a choice When you leave the farm and cross over Doe Tor Bridge, you can either return back up the river to High Down Ford and, after crossing the Lyd, follow the hedge back to the car park taking in the mining site of Wheal Mary Emma tin mine.\nAlternatively, if the weather is kind and the water level is low you may wish to brave a river crossing by some stepping stones. This path is marked in purple on the map and the rest of the description here follows that trail.\nWheal Mary Emma (Purple Route) Wheel Mary Emma was a tin mine built on the River Lyd some time between 1849 and 1900. The larger ruined stone building was likely a blowing house for producing tin ingots from the crushed ore.\nThere is still evidence of a banked-up track above the flatter dressing floors, with two round buddles. Next to these is a filled in wheelpit where water from the Lyd was diverted to drive a 30-40 foot water wheel, providing power to the whole mine site for pumping, ventilation and even driving the buddles. A stone-lined tunnel runs from the bottom of the wheelpit to the river bank below the scarp to let water drain back once it had done its job of turning the wheel. There was at least one shaft dug to extract tin on this site.\nHeritage Gateway MDV4679 - Mill Building When done exploring the mine workings, follow the path up the hill due West, which will take you back to the car park and conclude our walk\nParking The approach road to the free parking area is a little bumpy, but the parking itself is quite large and good.\nReferences Heritage Gateway MDV103222 - Doe Tor Farm MOD Historic Site Survey (PDF) ","date":"2025-02-01T20:27:31Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/lydford-high-down-to-doe-tor-farm-ruins/7_hu_8805ef26c09161d0.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/lydford-high-down-to-doe-tor-farm-ruins/","title":"Lydford High Down to Doe Tor Farm Ruins"},{"content":"Information Distance: 3 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words squeezed.refrained.basher Map Introduction This is an interesting walk over open moorland taking in a wide scope of history, from Bronze age and medieval remains, to an abandoned Victorian railway, and disused granite quarries - all with excellent views over Dartmoor and West Devon into Cornwall. There\u0026rsquo;s a small detour offered which takes in an abandoned Medieval Longhouse, its modern replacement and two ancient Pounds and hut circles.\nSharpitor Sharpitor is worth mentioning since it is owned since 1984 by Dartmoor Preservation Association and this ensures access will be preserved into the future.\nAlso note the diagonal linear feature in this photo - this is part of the Walkhampton Common East Reave.\nWhen ready, walk along the path to the North towards the rocky line and hut circles as per the route on the map\nReaves and Hut Circles Reaves - land boundaries of heaped stones\nThere are essentially four types of reaves:\nField boundaries to divide land into normally long strip-like fields for grazing or growing crops, akin to modern walls or hedges. Terminal reaves that are uphill from field boundaries that marked lower divided areas from uphill open or \u0026ldquo;common\u0026rdquo; land Reaves built usually along ridges to mark watersheds i.e. between river valleys Long divisions over kilometres marking out territories akin to parishes. The Walkhampton Common Reave is 3170 meters long and mostly straight. It was built in the Bronze Age (Between 4000 BC and 1000 BC), and forms a division between the Walkham and Meavy valleys, thus identifying it as a Reave of type 3 in the above list - built to separate two watersheds.\nHeritage Gateway MDV15038 - The Walkhampton Common Reave The figure above is reproduced from Andrew Fleming (1988) The Dartmoor Reaves - Investigating Prehistoric Land Divisions, BT Batsford Ltd, London, page 41\nContinue walking uphill towards Leeden Tor\nLeeden Tor The modern mast of North Hessary Tor transmitting station can be seen in the background. This was built in 1955 to supply 405-line television to Devon and is 196 meters (643 feet) tall.\nToday, it provides analogue FM radio covering a large area, including Devon, Cornwall, Somerset and South Wales.\nAdditionally, it provides Digital DAB radio and DVB-T television - and is a useful landmark to identify where Princetown is.\nNorth Hessary Tor transmitting station Great Western Reave Heading Northwest from Leeden Tor, we very soon cross another reave.\nThe Great Western Reave measures over 10 kilometres in length and is the longest known prehistoric land division boundary on Dartmoor. This record covers the most southerly section of the reave (two sections measuring a combined length of 2.58 kilometres). Along its length, the width of the reave varies between 2.5 metres and 4 metres, whilst its height varies between 0.2 metres and 0.7 metres - although it would have been higher when built. A second reave leads off at right angles at SX5577 7088 and there are hut circles and cairns associated with the reave.\nThis very long reave is a territorial boundary something akin to a modern parish boundary (and type 4 from the list above) It extends from near Sharpitor, near Dousland/Yelverton, to White Tor near Peter Tavy.\nHead North West about 450 meters, to\u0026hellip;\nIngra Tor Cairn and Cist This cist is described by Jeremy Butler, 1994, Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 3 - The South-West, 16: Ingra Tor cairn and cist (fig. 45.13), page 51.\nThe cist is a few metres above the Routrundle leat, which is about 23 metres down the slope. The leat is marked by a downhill bank but is really quite non-photogenic and it is not easy to see the actual \u0026ldquo;trench\u0026rdquo; that was the water course in photographs, so it is not included here.\nStone pits are generally places where walling or building stone was easily won from the ground because of natural fissures or weathering. Sometimes they\u0026rsquo;re mistaken for tinning holes where the old men would find small deposits of cassiterite - a rich source of tin ore. Those would usually have some spoil heaps nearby though, which aren\u0026rsquo;t evident here, so stone pits seems likely. The only two certain things about these holes however, is that they are impossible to date, and that they were made by man.\nIngra Tor and Quarry We aim for the Tor and pass to the left of it\nIngra Tor Quarry, like the nearby Swell Tor, King\u0026rsquo;s Tor and Foggintor Quarries, were run by the Johnson Brothers from 1820 to 1865 who paid a lease to the Duchy of Cornwall.\nIt was re-opened between 1936 and 1941 to cut kerbstones and granite setts for Devon County Council, and a platform was built on the railway called Ingra Tor Halt, just to the North of the Tor.\nIngra Tor Halt This once held a small shelter from the elements, built partly inside a pound. There was a short wooden platform to the single track railway. At the time of opening in 1936, a single fare from here to Princetown was 11 1/2d First Class, or 7d Second Class. The halt was built for quarry workers, but when the quarries closed, was used exclusively by walkers, most coming up from Plymouth. Walking from here to Princetown and then riding back home was a popular route before the railway closed on March 3, 1956. There was a famous sign here advising passengers to keep dogs on a lead due to the presence of adders. This sign is now kept at Buckfastleigh Station. (Above image hosted by the Princetown Railway site, which has a lot more interesting information about this railway)\nReferences\nMike Brown Guide to Dartmoor - CD-ROM (2001) Wikipedia - Ingra Tor Halt Railway Station Princetown Railway Website - Ingra Tor When ready, walk a short distance to the little bridge to the West\nThis bridge was built to provide safe passage for cattle and other livestock to cross the railway. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that the railway was fenced with posts and wire to keep stock off the line, so creeps like this were essential to allow free grazing under commoners rights.\nThis curious set of holes shows that this block was once used for a tramway in one of the nearby quarries. These holes held an iron plate which held the iron rails above it. Wear from those rails can be seen above and below. No longer of use there, it was re-used in constructing this creep.\nRailway We continue walking Southerly along the railway for around 500 meters\nRoutrundle (Detour) If you want to explore some more history, leave the railway to the west just before the walls come up from Routrundle and walk towards \u0026ldquo;Homestead\u0026rdquo; on the map. Otherwise carry along the railway as per the marked route on the map\nThis area of Dartmoor has been inhabited for at least four thousand years.\nThe earliest remains are the large circular pounds and nicely viewable via the aerial view below. This, together with the hut circles nearby, formed an early settlement around 4000 to 1000 BC and provide evidence of animal husbandry. To the Northwest are the stone ruins of a Medieval Longhouse, Smithy and other buildings built between 1066 and 1539. Routrundle is the \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; farmhouse dating from a mere 1866, currently inhabited. Build after and probably to replace Babyland Longhouse. There are claims this house dates back to 1417, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible that is confused with the Babyland property. Routrundle is no longer a working farm. It fell into disrepair and was left vacant after a Jim Fence left. \u0026ldquo;Routrundle\u0026rdquo; is named after the Bronze Age \u0026ldquo;trundles\u0026rdquo; or pounds still so visible today. Stags sales particulars (2018) give a good view of the property, inside and out. It sold for £618,000 in 2018. (Not pictured) There is a benchmark on the southwest side of the lane on a large boulder. SX55274 71832 The collection of trees in the above photo marks a Bronze Age pound and collection of hut circles. These can be accessed from a Bridlepath off the railway a little further on, along with a Medieval Longhouse marked on the map as \u0026ldquo;homestead\u0026rdquo; a little way North of . This was called Babyland. This is a long-inhabited area of Dartmoor.\nTithe maps were produced to assess the tithe payable in cash to the parish church for the support of the church and its clergy. This tithe had been paid in kind until The Commutation Act was passed in 1836, when it was agreed that this should be converted to a monetary payment.\nHeritage Gateway MDV14151 - Babyland Deserted Farmstead End Routrundle detour Whether you continued along the railway or explored through Routrundle and emerged from the bridlepath, leave the railway where the bridlepath joins it and head Southward over open moor to the car park to conclude our walk\nParking There are a couple of good roadside car parks at the posted locations.\nReferences Mike Brown Guide to Dartmoor - CD-ROM (2001) Wikipedia - Ingra Tor Halt Railway Station Princetown Railway Website - Ingra Tor Tithe maps Heritage Gateway MDV14151 - Babyland Deserted Farmstead ","date":"2025-01-17T19:38:02Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/ingra-tor/9_hu_2952abd641cf063f.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/ingra-tor/","title":"Ingra Tor"},{"content":"Information Distance: 2 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Gentle A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words cosmetic.outlawing.limes Map Note that the OS Map incorrectly names these woods as \u0026ldquo;Pullbrook\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;Pullabrook\u0026rdquo;\nIntroduction Owned and managed by the Woodland Trust, Pullabrook Woods is a lovely little area popular with dog walkers. There are woodland paths up the west side of the River Bovey, crossing it at a notable stone bridge, and back down the Eastern side, re-crossing close to the car park. It\u0026rsquo;s particularly lovely on a hot summer\u0026rsquo;s day as most is well shaded. The area is known for its wildlife, especially wild birds - with the rare Dartford Warbler, the Kingfisher and Pied Flycatcher seen here. There are also dormice, otter and bats with the river home to Salmon and Brown and Sea Trout.\nPullabrook Woods Also known as \u0026ldquo;Pullbrook Woods\u0026rdquo;, if only by Ordance Survey, these woodlands are 50 acres (20ha) in size and are a mix of ancient woodland and wildflower-rich wet meadows in the steep-sided valley of the River Bovey.\nThe name Pullabrook probably comes from the personal name, \u0026ldquo;Polla\u0026rdquo;, so in modern terms, \u0026ldquo;Polla\u0026rsquo;s Brook\u0026rdquo;\nThe nearby Pullabrook Farm is mentioned in the Domesday book of 1086 where it is written as \u0026ldquo;Polebroc\u0026rdquo; and was seized by William the Conquerer as part of the Bovi estate when the Normans invaded. As a reward for his support, William gave this estate to Geoffrey de Mowbray the Bishop of Coutances. The current farmhouse dates from the sixteenth century and is Grade II listed.\nBovey Tracey History - Pullabrook Follow the Bridleway West at the far end of the car park\nOld Manaton Road We briefly leave The Woodland\u0026rsquo;s Trust land and enter the bottom edge of Trendlebere Down, owned by English Heritage.\nThis unsealed track is, in fact, a fully legal road and you may see cars and motorbikes using it as well as cyclists, horseriders and walkers.\nBefore the road that travels above us on Trendlebere Down was built in the 19th Century, this was the original and main road between Bovey Tracey and Manaton.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now a Byway Open to All Traffic (BOAT) which means any road going vehicle can legally use it provided they are taxed and insured - although much of it is only suitable to off road vehicles.\nHeritage Gateway MDV124566 - Old Manaton Road Lustleigh Parish Boundary Stone This stone was erected in 2000, hence the Roman numerals, MM.\nLP stands for Lustleigh Parish which extends to the North.\nThe Pudding Stone The name \u0026ldquo;Pudding Stone\u0026rdquo; describe several types of rock around the world. In this case, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that this is just a natural lumps of granite that happens to resemble a pudding.\nIf you look closely, you will see that it has a inscribed feature of an arrow and line. This is a benchmark, likely carved during the 1800s when the Ordnance Survey did detailed mapping of the UK. There are over half a million of these symbols, some dating back to 1831, which provide a fixed point of reference. They are no longer created as technology has made them obsolete, but still a good reminder of how we created the most accurate maps in the world by measuring angles.\nOrdnance Survey - Benchmarks Wikipedia - Benchmark Hisley \u0026ldquo;Fairy\u0026rdquo; Bridge Hisley Bridge is a post-medieval bridge built some time between 1401 and 1750 to improve safe access over the river for pack horses when the river is in spate, making the ford difficult.\nThe pillar in the middle of the bridge is a modern addition to prevent off road vehicles from using the bridge, which had already caused damage.\nNote the slotted gatepost to one side, presumably to control use by pack pony drivers or to prevent livestock from crossing.\nNot shown, but there are the ruins of a pair of late medieval structures approximately 150m North-West of Hisley Bridge, known as Vinnamore, which may have been related to this bridge. Possibly dwellings of toll keepers, or a valley farm with grazing on Trendlebere.\nThere are also remains of a 19th century weir nearby.\nHeritage Gateway MDV124630 - Hisley Bridge\nHeritage Gateway MDV28070 - Deserted Settlement\nWe cross the bridge and follow the lower path to the right, downstream\nHisley and Rudge Woods Rudge Meadow Emerging from Rudge Woods, we find ourselves in Rudge Meadow.

It has been improved since then.\nLustleigh Tithe Map, 1838 Go through the gate and turn right down the road\nAt this junction, a short detour left is recommended to the viaduct\nPacksaddle Bridge and Viaduct The viaduct once carried the GWR Moretonhampstead Railway Branch Line. This opened in 1866 as an independent line, and amalgamated with the GWR ten years later. British Rail nationalised it in 1948 and it closed in 1964 - another victim of Dr Beeching\u0026rsquo;s cuts.\nPart of this line remains from Newton Abbot to Heathfield, although it has not been used for several years. It was resurrected briefly in the 2000\u0026rsquo;s to take away timber from Teign Grace halt but has since been idle.\nYou can see more evidence of the railway in many places from Newton Abbot to Moretonhampstead - such as the railway sheds at Bovey Tracey, many viaducts such as this, and some engine sheds at the Thompson\u0026rsquo;s lorry yard where it terminated. Much of the route is now a shared-use path for walkers, cyclists and horseriders.\nThere was a nearby Pullabrook Halt railway stop, which was renamed in 1955 from Hawksmoor Halt, for the (not so nearby) Tuberculosis Sanitorium.\nWikipedia - Moretonhampstead and South Devon Railway Wikipedia - Pullabrook Halt Railway Station When ready, turn around and head back towards the car park\nDrakeford Bridge William Crossing refers to this as New Bridge in the 1912 edition of Crossing\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Dartmoor, and it is also known as Letford Bridge.

Many won\u0026rsquo;t be aware of the rich history surrounding the area, and the peace and quiet that can be had just a few minutes walking away from the road. Our walk takes you over Wigford Down to The Dewerstone with its commanding views. We visit a Bronze Age Walled Enclosure, hut circles, cairns, a neolithic wall, rock inscriptions and many other items of interest.\nFrom the car park, head towards the bridge and cross over, turning left when you can towards Cadover Cross\nCadover Bridge Cadover Bridge was known as Cadworthy Bridge in the 1840 Meavy Tithe Map. The nearby farm is Lower Cadworthy Farm where \u0026ldquo;worthy\u0026rdquo; is from the Saxon \u0026ldquo;worthig\u0026rdquo; meaning a one-family smallholding and \u0026ldquo;Cad\u0026rdquo; being a local word for the River Plym. Cad is also a Celtic word meaning conflict or strife, but it\u0026rsquo;s thought the former is the more accurate meaning.\n\u0026ldquo;In the charter of Isabella de Fortibus, 1291, the river is called Plymma from its source downward, and the confluence is thus referred to, \u0026ldquo;locum ubi Mewy cadit in Plymma\u0026rdquo;. The bridge, probably then a clapper, is called in the same charter \u0026ldquo;ponte de Cadaworth.\u0026rdquo; This name is taken from the Saxon worthig close by now called Cadworthy, and which was apparently formed on the site of a British battle - cad being a Celtic word meaning conflict or strife.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; William Crossing, 1912\nMeavy Tithe Map Sheepwash Chronicle - Devon Place Names Cadover Cross Also known as Wigford Down Cross. In 1873 the original section of the cross was found lying flat on the ground by a group of soldiers who were on an exercise from their camp on Ringmoor Down and, working with the then Vicar of Shaugh Prior, re-erected the cross.\nBy 1901 the cross had fallen again, and in 1915 a subsequent vicar arranged its restoration, including a new shaft:\nIn seeking a more secure site in which to erect the cross, he came across a green sward in the heather which he thought would make an ideal spot. Whilst digging a hole in the ground for the cross, he came across a large granite boulder which turned out to be the original socket stone for the cross, still in situ. \u0026ndash; Dartmoor Crosses\nThis tall cross is a waymarker on the Monastic Way between Priory and Tavistock Abbey.\nThe medieval track ran from Plympton to Stony Cross aka Shaden Moor Cross, which is near the summit of Shaugh Moor on the Plympton-Cadover road, following the line of the modern road to near Cadover Bridge.\nClose to the modern bridge was a ford, Cad-a-ford, (ford over the Cad) perhaps fifty-metres upstream. From here the track would go straight uphill from the ford to Marchant\u0026rsquo;s Cross, for Meavy. A sidebranch turned left for Wigford Down, up past Cadaford Cross as an alternative route over the Down.\nNot only is there a second cross carved inside the main cross, but there were also another cross centered on each arm itself, and possibly more that have eroded from weather.\nEric Hemery - Walking Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Ancient Tracks (1986) Dartmoor Crosses - Cadover Cross Heritage Gateway - MDV2444 - Wigford Down Cross Historic England - Wigford Down Cross Leaving the cross, follow the hedge NorthWest and around to the West for about a kilometer\nWigford Down Cairn Cist This was a Bronze Age Burial Cist. Later farmers, still from the Bronze Age, built a field division across the eastern half of it. A rare thing, as they are known to have respected the Old Men\u0026rsquo;s artifacts and normally avoiding disturbing them.\nCadworthy Tor Cadworthy Tor is also known as Cadover Tor and, on the 1840 Meavy Parish Tithe Map - Oxen Tor.\nDewerstone Hill Fort This promontory is the site of a Neolithic Hill Fort, dating back around five thousand years. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to see that a well stocked force here would be difficult to attack, with a high defensive wall to the Northeast, and the steeply sloping gradient in all other directions.\nThis low mount of rubble is a Neolithic (Circa 2,500 BCE) defensive structure which would have been much more imposing almost five thousand years ago and a formidable obstruction to any attackers.\nThe single walled structure on this map, closer to The Dewerstone, is Bronze Age and is around two thousand years younger than the outer Neolithic double wall.\nNational Trust - Dewerstone Heritage Gateway MDV2380 - Dewerstone Hillfort Heritage Gateway MDV63618 - Hut Circle, Dewerstone The Dewerstone \u0026ldquo;Dewer\u0026rdquo; is an ancient Celtic word for the Devil.\nThe Devil, riding a gigantic black horse, gallops across the Moor each night and leads a phantom pack of black hounds to chase weary or foolish humans over the Dewerstone to their deaths. \u0026ndash; Dartmoor legend\nThe higher flat rocks are incised, see below.\nThe phrase is from a Chinese Proverb. It is unknown who put this here or why.\nWikipedia - Dewerstone When ready to leave, head back out over the double walled structure to the Northeast as per the map\nThe L Stone There are perhaps eight of these \u0026ldquo;L stones\u0026rdquo; running across Wigford Down.\nThese are boundary stones between the lands of Sir Ralph Lopes (of Maristow Estate to the north-east) and Mr Scobell (holding enclosed land at Urgles / Goodameavy, to the south-west), settled after a meeting on the Down as described in a letter by the Maristow steward and land agent George Giles.\nOn 18th February 1841, George Giles, the steward and land agent of the Maristow-owned manors, wrote to a land surveyor by the name of William J Stentaford, thus: \u0026ldquo;I have been with Sir Ralph Lopes \u0026amp; Mr Scobell on Wigford Down this day they both returned to my office \u0026hellip; and ultimately agreed on an equal division of the 393a 3r 15p, the boundary to be shown by Granite posts, when the line has been traced — and that Mr Scobell’s portion shall be that moiety next adjoining his inclosed lands of Urgles and Good-a-Meavy beginning north from the corner of outher Diamond park \u0026hellip; across towards Oxen Torr — or somewhere in that direction, wherever the line of equal division may fall \u0026hellip; the line \u0026hellip; must be taken up from Sir Trayton Drake’s boundary of Greenwell Down — and should it fall upon Shaugh Prior Boundary it must not be carried across it \u0026hellip; This is a matter that requires your earliest attention. Sir Ralph and Mr Scobell will again meet on the locus in quo when you are prepared to shew the divisional line. This Job is to be at the joint expense of each party.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; Mike Brown Ralph Lopes (1788-1854) was MP for Westbury, a pocket borough controlled by his uncle, Manesseh Masseh Lopes, until his uncle\u0026rsquo;s death in 1831.\nHe then inherited his uncle\u0026rsquo;s Baronetcy and his estate of Maristow - and the right to nominate future MPs at Westbury. A right removed in the Reform Act 1832\nIn 1841 there was a boundary disagreement between Lopes and his neighbour, Mr Scobell, which culminated with them formally reaching an agreeing on where their lands met. A formal letter was drawn up and these stones were placed to mark the boundary.\nWikipeadia - Ralph Lopes\nMike Brown - Dartmoor\nDartmoor Explanations - Wigford Down Standing Stones\nWhen ready, walk uphill across open moorland to the Wigford Down Summit, North-Northeast of the L Stone\nThe above image might help make sense of the various features that you encounter as you cross the down towards the Summit Cairns.\nSummit Cairns These two cairns would have been much more imposing once, but they have been robbed for road building over the centuries. The near one was almost completely removed, leaving a depression caused by the weight of the stones above it. This formed a dew pond which has deepened as livestock erodes it in the search for water.\nThere are remains of five summit cairns in this vicinity, all of which have been damaged in various ways.\nThis one was once an Observation Post during World War 2, and remains of the concrete which topped it may still be seen.\nHeritage Gateway MDV2312 - Summit Cairn on Wigford Down When ready, walk a short distance Northeast to the corner of the stockfencing\nBA Stones So what does BA mean?

I\u0026rsquo;ve included a possible detour if you wanted to extend the walk to include Swincombe Intake.\nMuch of this land is owned by Anton Coaker who lives at Sherberton Farm who farms the distinctive red Galloway cattle and Dartmoor ponies on this land.\nThe Coaker\u0026rsquo;s dedication to breeding good quality Dartmoor Ponies is well known and is several generations long. I recall visiting his mother, Diane Coaker, at Sherberton farm to view some of her ponies with my own mother in the 1980s. \u0026ndash; Simon\nAnton himself is very well known as the author of several books, newspaper articles and is a very knowledgeable and erudite writer on Moorland and Hill Farming matters.\nAnton Coaker\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Our Farm\u0026rdquo; website Start the walk by proceeding back 140 meters along the road you approached the parking along, then turn right at the end of the wall along a Bridlepath\nDartmoor has had many fine dry stone wall builders, but perhaps the most famous of all was John Bishop (1821-1892). He was one of the first to use the shaped and squared building method in his walls. He tightly fitted large blocks of granite in such a way that very little daylight could be seen through the wall. He helped enclose many of the newtakes on Dartmoor and would have been in strong demand.\nWhen asked how he lifted such heavy stones, John Bishop is alleged to have replied, “Aw, ‘tis surprisin’ what ee can do with a laiver or two.”\nMany of the walls in this area were built or repaired by Mr Bishop who lived close by - we\u0026rsquo;ll visit his house on this walk - and are of a visibly better quality than most earlier walls, which were mostly built from natural moorstone, using \u0026ldquo;trigs\u0026rdquo; of small stone to wedge them in place. But no matter how well a dry stone wall is made, it needs repairing often due to weather and especially animals and people climbing it and loosening stone, so other men will have been involved over the years in keeping these walls stockproof.\nDolly Trebble\u0026rsquo;s Cott Leave the path after about 900 meters and head towards the ruins on the right as indicated on the map\nDolly Trebble was a particularly attractive girl who caught the eye of many men of Dartmoor in the 18th Century. Despite being married to William Trebble, she was courted by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt (1762-1833) - an important man who shaped much of Princetown and Dartmoor, and no less than George IV, the Prince Regent who visited here several times.\nShe was written about by Sabine Baring Gould and Dolly was clearly a woman of some fame. Tim Sandles has an entertaining version of Dolly\u0026rsquo;s story on his Legendary Dartmoor site if you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more.\nLegendary Dartmoor - Dolly Treble When ready, proceed down to join the moor road to the west and walk a short way to the bridge over the river Swincombe, where you have a choice\nDetour to Swincombe Intake Possible detour (An extra mile and a half)\nIf you continue walking along this road to the west, after around 1.2km you\u0026rsquo;ll come to the Swincombe Intake. This is a small reservoir and unusual art-deco building that collects water which is piped to Venford Reservoir to help fill it.\nThe Swincombe Intake Reservoir was built between 1929 and 1933 by Paignton Urban District Council Waterworks Department. A particularly ugly building with the exception of an art deco motif over the modern door, as befitting its construction date.\nIf you took this detour, head back to the same point at the Fairy bridge when you are ready to return\nThe flooding of Swincombe Valley This valley starts up at Peat Cott with the infamous Foxtor Mire at its head, which acts as a huge sponge providing a steady flow throughout even the driest of summers.\nIt was that which prompted a plan in the 1960s to flood this entire valley to provide another reservoir on Dartmoor, far larger than the modest intake that has stood there for a hundred years.\nNot surprisingly, this caused a lot of opposition. Perhaps the most vocal opponent was Lady Sylvia Sayer who, with the Dartmoor Preservation Association, resisted this at every turn. You will by now have noticed that you\u0026rsquo;re not under several meters of water, so it should be no surprise to learn that in 1970, the opposers won and permission was refused. Planning was retried several times through the 70s and 80s until in 1985, the DPA used funds from a bequest to acquire 50 acres of this valley to protect it.\nDartmoor Preservation Association - Swincombe Fairy Bridge There has been a bridge at this location for hundreds of years, and noted by William Crossing in the early 1900s. It has been replaced several times.\nIt earned its nickname as a small porcelain fairy was mounted to one of the supports by persons unknown. Unfortunately it was damaged and replaced at least once.\nPlease note that apparently the bridge has been replaced since these pictures were taken and it\u0026rsquo;s unknown whether the Fairy returned\nJohn Bishop\u0026rsquo;s House Cross the bridge\nJohn Bishop was the dry stone waller whose work we inspected earlier. He lived in this house in the 1800s when it was in much better condition. Originally thatched, it was later converted to slates and was reported to be in liveable condition as late as the 1960s.\nYou can just make out the A for Ashburton in this picture, with a slightly fainter T for Tavistock on the rear face. This was used to mark the packhorse trail and give the direction to the respective towns.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve explored the ruins, return over the bridge and follow the road East\nGobbett Mine Left and right of the path just before we leave this road, is the site of Gobbett Tin Mine. There are remnants of this work still visible, as well as the very obvious tunnel.\nThe mine ran from 1836 to 1874 but did not produce large yields.\nOre from the adit would be smashed down small enough to fit into the top hole of this stone which sat above the base stone. The top stone was then rotated, possibly by pony or donkey or water power, to grind the ore just as grain is turned into wheat. The resulting fine sand was then smelted to form ingots.\nOnce smelted and the impurities floated off, the near-pure tin was poured into a mould stone to form a 200lb ingot. This was a standard weight for transporting by pony off the moor.\nThe chemical symbol for Tin is \u0026ldquo;Sn\u0026rdquo; which stands for stannous or stannic. From this comes the Latin for Tin, Stannum. From that, comes Stannator (Stannary parliament), stannary laws, stannary towns etc. Wikipedia - Tin Wikipedia - Dartmoor Tin Mining Tunnel Above the main Gobbett Mine workings was the main adit which followed the mineral seam. When the Swincombe Intake was built in the 1920s, the builders needed to run a pipe from there to the Venford Reservoir some 6 kilometers away. They opted to reuse and extend this adit to run that pipe through. The tunnel continues through the hill in a straight line for 540 meters, emerging in a field 150m North West of The Forest Inn. *When you are ready, join the larger access road to the East and follow it 400m upwards to the Parking.\nParking There is good roadside parking available at the posted coordinates, just outside the entrance to Sherberton\u0026rsquo;s land.\nReferences Crockern Farm - John Bishop Most of these pictures were taking from Keith\u0026rsquo;s walk in 2009, although I have added some of my own from 2011 for the Intake and Tunnel \u0026ndash; Simon ","date":"2025-01-01T10:30:07Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/hexworthy-to-swincombe/12_hu_fda4ce1b6a758634.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/hexworthy-to-swincombe/","title":"Hexworthy to Swincombe"},{"content":"Information Distance: 3 miles, walked by Simon Avery and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Gentle A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words disengage.pats.waltz Map Introduction This is one of my favourite walks and is never busy, despite being so close to Haytor Rock. Most people seem to overlook Haytor Down in their eagerness to get into other parts of the moor but there is much to appreciate here, from stunning views over Teignmouth\u0026rsquo;s coastline, to an abandoned quarry, the stover granite tramway and a lovely stretch of ancient woodland.\nThis walk can be done in either direction, but anti-clockwise is advised, as you can then appreciate the views full as you walk down the Granite Tramway.\nGeocaching Geocaching is a game of finding hidden containers using a GPS or Smart Phone. The containers have a small paper log which you sign to prove you were there, and a website where you log your find. Basic membership is free. If this sounds a lot like Letterboxing, that\u0026rsquo;s because it is based on it, but brought up to date. Many Dartmoor walkers and Letterboxers also geocache as they go hand in hand, and Geocaches are a good way to find interesting places to explore.\nThere is a series of Geocaches that follow this walk (that\u0026rsquo;s why I know this area, I set these caches and walk this route to maintain them once or twice a year!) If that sounds interesting, pop over to the first cache page of the series\nStarting the walk Leave the car park and walk down the road to where the granite tramway crosses it, some 300 meters. Turn left and follow the tramway East.\nHaytor Granite Tramway We follow this old tramway for about a mile downhill\nThis tramway was built on the instruction of George Templer (1781-1843), a family that also built the main Haytor Quarries, the Stover Canal and Stover House in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The gauge of this tramway is 4'3\u0026quot; and it\u0026rsquo;s taken from granite cut and shaped at the Haytor quarries. There are sets of points further up the tramway where the trams could be steered into different quarries or sidings. Granite cut from Haytor or Holwell Quarries was loaded onto strong wooden trucks (See picture below) The Tramway runs down from Haytor Rocks to Stover Canal, where the granite would be transferred to sailing barges to take it to Teignmouth docks. Around 12 of these trucks were connected together in a \u0026ldquo;train\u0026rdquo; with the iron wheels sitting in the flat sections. A team of around 18 horses was then connected in single file to one end of the train. If it was loaded and heading downhill, the horses would be fixed to the last truck to provide braking. If they were pulling the trucks back up from Stover, they would be hitched to the front to better pull. The tramway is intact for much of its original course, down through Yarner Woods, past Bovey and on to Stover. This Haytor Tramway wagon is kept at the DNPA Head Office at Parke, Bovey Tracey.\nOn a clear day, the views along this section look over South Devon towards the gap in the land where the Teign Estuary reaches the sea at Teignmouth.\nWhen we reach a cross roads with a wooden signpost, leave the Tramway (Templer Way) and turn left, slightly uphill\nHaytor Down Quarry Much less known than its larger brothers closer to the Tor. There is some corrugated iron just to the right where a shed or small building once stood.\nWoodland Walk We walk gently upwards along this bridlepath for almost a mile, enjoying the many fine and unusual trees\nThe Haytor Down Adits The sound of running water will alert you to this large collector tank above the path - it always seems to be overflowing even in the driest summer, and runs across the path here.\nThe water is fed into this tank from a blue alkathene pipe, which continues up the hill over loose waste rock. If you follow it, it actually enters a gated Adit which is always dripping and provides a clearly sufficient flow.\nThere are actually two adits here, about a hundred meters apart on the same level, both with small fences and gates, and usually padlocked.\nThese adits don\u0026rsquo;t go far in, and side trials are short. The waste rock outside has a red tinge which indicates iron, so it\u0026rsquo;s likely that\u0026rsquo;s what was being searched for.\nThe actual adit area is quite overgrown now, but worth a detour if you like adits and don\u0026rsquo;t mind a bit of a scramble through undergrowth.\nThe sight of this cable box always seems at odd with the timeless, even primeval nature of these woods.\nYarner House You may spot some rooftops downhill as you\u0026rsquo;re walking along. These belong to Yarner House. This is a Grade II Listed Tudor house dating back to the 1600s and has been renovated to a luxurious standard.\nThe Yarner House estate is 247 acres. It was part of the Manor of Bovey Tracey which William the Conqueror (Norman invader of 1066, also known as William the Bastard) siezed and then granted to Geoffrey de Mowbray, Bishop of Coutances. On de Mowbray’s death in 1093, his nephew, Robert Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, inherited, but later defied the king, which led to the seizure of his estates in 1095. Eventually, ownership of the Bovey Tracey estates reverted to the Crown until, in the 16th century, a succession of costly wars left Tudor monarchs strapped for cash. Elizabeth I began to sell off Crown properties and, in 1578, the Yarner estate was bought by Gregory Sprint, a canny lawyer with good Court connections, who swiftly resold it at a profit. The estate includes Yarner Woods, which is managed by Natural England and has several miles of woodland paths open to the public. There are copper mines in Yarner woods which, combined with other mines and quarries contributed to the wealth of the estate. Today, it is a Hotel that offers Bed \u0026amp; Breakfast.\nTripadvisor entry for Yarner House Countrylife article for Yarner House On clear days, the view over this hedge is most pleasing, taking in Bovey Tracey and the hills behind.\nAs we approach the road, curve left and join it back up the hill to the parking\nParking This walk starts at the blue parking on this map, but sometimes that can get busy. If so, alternative parking is shown by red stars on the map.\nThere are toilets and an Information Centre at the nearby Haytor Lower Car Park.\n","date":"2024-12-29T14:18:32Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/haytor-down/25_hu_844baca94ee9a29c.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/haytor-down/","title":"Haytor Down"},{"content":"Information Distance: 3 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words good.highlighted.supple Map Introduction This walks takes us up the Northwestern slopes to Sourton Tors, stopping to view the Iceworks on the way. After admiring the views from the Tor, we make a short detour to visit the Applecrusher before following the gradient around the Western face of the tor and back to the car park.\nLeave the car park and head Southwards upwards along the paths\nDartmoor reaves are ancient long, straight lines of stone or earth that were built during the Bronze Age, primarily between 1500 and 1200 BC.\nThe exact purpose of the reaves remains somewhat debated, but they are believed to have served a variety of functions, such as Boundary Markers, Agricultural features to contain livestock or for ceremonial or ritual practices.\nDartmoor has the most extensive and well preserved systems of prehistoric field boundaries in Europe.\nWikipedia - Reave Iceworks This system of earthworks and ruined buildings hints at one of the attempts to bend Dartmoor to man\u0026rsquo;s will. It can be viewed as a Folly, for it was not successful.\nThese works date from 1875 when a Mr James Henderson leased the land from the Duchy of Cornwall for a period of 15 years and he was allowed to \u0026ldquo;form ponds, and collect, and store ice for a term of 21 years running from February 1875 at an annual rent of £10.\u0026rdquo; He spent several thousand pounds setting up this endeavour.\nThe ponds were not allowed to be deeper than three feet and must be securely fenced. It was an agreement that upon completion, that the land be returned to its natural state.\nThe plan was simple enough - to fill ponds with water and wait for winter to freeze them. Then ice would be cut and transported to Plymouth for sale, at up to £3 a ton.\nUnfortunately, events worked against Mr Henderson. A series of unusually mild winters meant little or no ice was produced, and then a rival company set up in Plymouth that created ice all year around, and that dropped the price to just £1 a ton, with none of the transport costs associated with hauling it there. Although this spelled the ending for these Iceworks, the Plymouth Rival also went out of business.\nThe scheme collapsed and a meeting was called with the Duchy in 1886 to surrender the lease early. Mr Henderson had tried to sell the Iceworks as a going concern for a little as £100 - a huge loss on his investment - but there were no takers and it remained unsold. As you can see, the land was never returned to its natural state so remains as a monument to risky business plans.\nLegendary Dartmoor - Iceworks This hole appears to be a core sample, taken by unknown persons. It\u0026rsquo;s not a drill mark, nor a tare and feather hole. Nor is it a rock worm, as suggested by some wags.\nTo a non-expert, this rock seems to be sedimentary, then changed by heat into a metamorphic rock. Perhaps it is unusual and that\u0026rsquo;s why it was sampled?\nDNPA Meldon Geology Case Study (PDF) When ready, walk upwards towards the tor\nSourton Tors When done admiring the views, head Southeast around 375m towards the junction of several paths at a small pond\nApplecrusher This style of crush had a horse, pony, donkey or ox walking around with a rigid wooden bar mounted to its harness. This was connected through the middle of a heavy, round stone or hardwood wheel that ran in the groove and onto the central pivot. As the wheel turned, apples would be thrown into the groove and mashed. There would be a run-off channel for the juice, which was collected to turn into Cider. As you can imagine, this created a lot of juice and would have needed several people to operate efficiently, giving an indication of scale and how important Cider was to Devonians.\nThis specific example was either broken when being carved, or during transport. Or it was intended to be made in two halves to make it easier to carry. It\u0026rsquo;s not known where the other half is.\nBoundary Stone We now head down the track to the Southwest, bearing right after a hundred meters or so, aiming just left of the Sourton Tors outcroppings\nAmerican Influence American Soldiers trained in this area when preparing for D-Day in 1945. Although hard to distinguish, the above feature was a former World War II Machine Gun Nest. Fortunately never needed on Dartmoor, but a sobering reminder of the many lives were lost across the Channel.\nKeep following the gradient below the Western side of Sourton Tors and then head back to the parking\nParking Turn off at the main A386 Tavistock to Okehampton road, passing between the embankments of the old railway - now the Granite Way.

Its history is interesting and worth a visit. There are often a very nice heard of Dartmoor ponies grazing around Wind Tor and Southern Hamel Down. (Please keep your distance and definitely do not feed)\nTwo Crosses Stone In the bank opposite the starting car park is this modern stone, dating from 2008. The former gatepost was donated by a Mr R Whale and was carved by the Dartmoor National Park Authority using their stonemason, Andy Cribbett. When completed, a ceremony was held on the 10th of July 2008 and the stone placed.\nBut why?\nThis location is the point where the manors of Jordon, Blackslade, Dunstone and Widecombe town intersect. Always known as ‘Two Crosses in the Turf’ this location was always marked by two crosses cut into the turf, every year the village lengthsman would re-cut them to ensure of their visibility. \u0026ndash; Legendary Dartmoor - Two Crosses\nFollow the path behind the stone towards Wind Tor\nLeft to right: Honeybag Tor (Elevation 445m/1459 feet). Chinkwell Tor (456m/1496 feet). Bell Tor (354m, 1161 feet)\nWind Tor When I was about 12 years old in the mid 1980s, I stayed for a short time at the nearby Rowden Adventure Centre. We walked up here and we were shown the first Letterbox which was hidden under these rocks, which helped spark a lifelong interest in finding tupperware in crevices \u0026ndash; Simon\nLegend says that this row of holes are the footprints left by a fox that the Devil transformed as he chased it across the moor\u0026hellip;\nOr drill holes for splitting the rock by tare and feathers, you decide.\nWhen you are ready, continue walking due South towards the wall corner below. Although the map mentions Hut Circles at this point, there is sadly little to be seen today. We then join the open moor road and follow it to the junction where we turn right towards Drywell\nDrywell Cross This was probably one a gate hanger stone, where the upright of the gate was cupped at the top to allow swinging before iron hinges were readily available.\nThis stone was once a waymarker to Widecombe Church and was restored in 1967 by Dartmoor Preservation Association. The replacement shaft matches the cross head in that all limbs are octagonal.\nDartmoor-Crosses - Drywells Cross Turn right at the cross and head North toward Dockwell\nDockwell Dockwell dates back to at least the Medieval period and has several traditional Dartmoor stone buildings.\nShortly past Dockwell, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a signpost pointing off the road to Hutholes. We follow that path, returning here afterwards\nHutholes Hutholes was a settlement of six buildings dating back to the Saxon period. It was certainly occupied at the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066 and seized by the invading French.\nDaily routine revolved around farming, growing crops, animal husbandry and household chores.\nAbandoned some time in the 14th century, it lay largely forgotten until 1963 when the local farmer, Mr Hermon French, talked about it to a Mrs Minter, who organised an archaeological dig,\nWe use the house numbers as given on the board.\nHouse 3, believed to be occupied up to the 12th century. This was probably original Depdona Manor house. The name was later changed to Dewdon and once this site was abandoned, was relocated half a mile away and renamed again, this time to Jordan.\nIn the Domesday Book (1066 AD), Depdona was owned by a wealthy Englishman called Alric. By 1086 it had been relinquished to one of the conquerors, William de la Falaise \u0026ndash; (Butler, Vol. 1 page 142)\nLegendary Dartmoor - Hutholes Once you have explored Hutholes, follow the path back to the road and turn left, then straight across the next crossroads\nParking There is roadside parking at the top of Wind Hill.

A medium walk through quiet woodland with some climbs on mostly firm forestry tracks.\nThe shed we park by was originally built for the forestry workers, but now is used mostly for storage. Fernworthy forest was first planted in 1921 by the Duchy of Cornwall. At that time there was a national shortage of timber following the First World War and much was needed quickly, leading to a nationwide conifer planting scheme. The forest comprises mostly of Sitka Spruce with some Douglas Fir and Japanese Larch. All are well suited to the Dartmoor conditions and provide a change of habitat for much wildlife. There are also pockets of deciduous woodland, notably around the reservoir. The Reservoir was built 1936-1942 by Torquay Water Authority and was the last granite dam built on Dartmoor at a cost of £246,000 - twice the original tender. It covers 76 acres and holds 380 million gallons. It\u0026rsquo;s 63 feet deep and water is piped to Trenchford Reservoir. Start our walk by walking about 350m back along the road you entered by, and turning right into the Woodland through a gateway\nLowton Brook West Settlement The Lowton Brook West Settlement was described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 2 - The North, 35.4 - Lowton Brook West, page 157.\nThere are eleven huts in this area, with this one being the furthest north, and the largest at 9.1 metres diameter. They date from the Bronze age, approximately 3300 BC to 1200 BC. The climate of Dartmoor was much milder then and many small settlements remain from human occupation of the time.\nEach Hut Circle is the site of what was probably a fairly typical Bronze Age Roundhouse, with walls of stone and a thatched roof. A central firepit will have provided cooking and heat.\nMost of the stone has been robbed by successive moor men, who used it for other buildings or walling, leaving the heavier base stones.\nThis gatepost was cut much later than the hut circles, likely in the medieval period or even later.\nFollow the track to the Southeast above Lowton brook, and take a sharp right up a steep hill\nTurn Left here and follow the track up the spine of the ridge, beating right after about 300 meters\nAssycombe Double Stone Row 125 meters long Faces North Westerly and oriented East Northeast to West Southwest. Restored in the 1890s There\u0026rsquo;s a menhir at the top end and a blocking stone at the bottom. Includes 133 medium and large sized stones. Originally there were 11 more stones, including a second blocking stone. J Butler notes that the row is very similar to the Hurston Ridge Double Stone Row, only 1km away. The hut circles probably came long after the stone row was erected, and it\u0026rsquo;s thought that the builders respected the row. Certainly, they did not steal its stones to build their huts, which would have been convenient.\nThe stone row is described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 2 - Asacombe Hill stone rows. This double row is similar to its neighbour on Hurston Ridge, a kilometre to the east. It is possible that a third row was planned but never installed, because the rows do not align well with the centre of the cairn.\nFollow the track down to Assycombe Farm\nAssycombe Farm Assycombe (Also Asacombe) Farm is the ruin of a deserted Medieval and Post-Medieval farmstead. There are two rectangular buildings with a field.\nA shard of pottery recovered from this site has been positively dated to 13th-14th Century The Longhouse to the South is the oldest of the two buildings.

This is to allow animals to leave the richer farm grazing and venture forth onto the moor.\nHeritage Gateway MDV52653 - Corn ditch within Trowlesworthy Warren, Shaugh Prior Outhome Cist Cuckoo Rock The name is said to come from this being the place where a local farmer always heard the first cuckoo, although one can also believe that it looks like a cuckoo\u0026rsquo;s egg in a nest of small eggs.\nIt was once a tradition for young boys to climb this rock, which is a bit of a struggle.\nShaft Just to the right of this and behind the wall, is a mine shaft that\u0026rsquo;s marked \u0026ldquo;Shaft\u0026rdquo; on the map.\nAdit Tip: To find this adit, cross the second stile going north from the corner of the forest.

The large lawn slopes away down to an ancient ford and often has Dartmoor Ponies and sheep grazing. This was once a mining village, with the valley between Belstone and Sticklepath hugely industrialised, although it\u0026rsquo;s hard to see traces of that now.\nBelstone Stocks Once present in most villages, stocks were used to shame and punish transgressors - often for crimes against the church. The victim was secured in place so that anyone passing could taunt them, or throw rotten fruit at them - I\u0026rsquo;m sure many old grudges were settled here.\nThe stocks themselves have been replaced many times, and it\u0026rsquo;s reported that a blow up doll was punished here for the village\u0026rsquo;s Millenium celebrations.\nLegendary Dartmoor - Belstone Stocks\nMemorial Stone GRV 22.VI 1911 GRV = George Rex V King George V - Coronation 22 June 1911 E II R 1952 2002 Commemorating 50 years reign of Queen Elizabeth II who acceded to the throne on the death of King George VI on 6 Feb 1952\nThe Pound Zion Chapel and Telegraph Office The sign above the door says \u0026ldquo;Telegraph Office\u0026rdquo; and there is a more modern telephone box outside, also an old Post Collection Box in the wall.\nBefore it was a Telegraph Office (1937-1979) this building was a Zion Methodist Chapel (1840-1841) and Sunday School. (1856-1899)\nHeritage Gateway MDV109484 - Zion Chapel, Belstone St Mary the Virgin Church A church was first built here in 1260.\nIncised Celtic Cross This celtic cross has moved around. Believed carved between the 7th and 9th centuries AD, William Crossing writes that it was rediscovered at this chapel when some stairs were taken down in 1861. It was then taken to a nearby rectory and built into a wall. It was returned here in 1920 when the Old Rectory was abandoned\nDartmoor Crosses - Belstone Incised Cross For our walk, we leave the village now by taking the road to the Northwest, before turning left into a path and then out onto the moor at Old Rectory Farm - the site where the above cross spent some time\nBelstone Cleave Rocks We turn back south now, but follow the contour path due Southwards around the enclosures\nWatchett Hill Cottage Watchet Hill Cottage, also known as Black Hut or Black House, was built around 1800 and last occupied in the mid 1960s before falling into disrepair.\nNotably, the author Eden Philpotts stayed here before making the house of the main locations in his famous novel, The Secret Woman.\n\u0026ldquo;The mean dwelling house of Watchet Hill faced north.

A single stone apart from the others was the piper who played a tune for them, and he was similarly treated.\nApparently, if you visit at noon or when the Belstone church bells ring, you can see the stones swaying gently.\nThis stone circle was originally a burial mound or kistvaen covered in earth. The grave was robbed many years ago, and the mound of earth to the Southwest was likely what was dug off.\nAs known as: The Dancing Stones. The Seventeen Brothers. The Nine Stones.\nLegendary Dartmoor - Nine Maidens Benchmark Benchmarks in stone walls are rare on Dartmoor - farmers know that stone is often moved when walls are rebuilt, although perhaps this example was thought too large to be easily relocated.\nBenchmarks are fixed reference points used for surveying, often employed by the Ordnance Survey\nFollow the paths to the Northeast as we start to descend back to the Village\nThe Tarka Trail is a long distance foot and cyclepath taking a figure-8 tour of places described by Henry Williamson in his 1927 novel Tarka the Otter.\nWater Works The Tors Parking There\u0026rsquo;s a good sized parking area on the approach to the village.

This particular mine was dug for Tin.\nAdits are horizontal tunnels used in mining. Some are used for access in and out and some are used for draining upper levels of water. This one is only open for about 10 meters, and was worked in tandem with the shafts on the slope immediately above it.\nThere would have been a spoil heap here when they were dug, but that has been removed by later activity.\nHeritage Gateway MDV120318 - Adit west of the West Okement River at Meldon Quarry Heritage Gateway MDV120320 - Mine shafts west of the West Okement River at Meldon Quarry Wheelpits This is one of two wheelpits found here and is the earliest, showing on the 1841 Tithe Map. A large waterwheel once ran here and was to drive a series of flat-rods back and forth motion which carried the power to the nearby quarry where it powered pumps to keep the water free of water, which at its end reached a depth of 130 feet.\nThere is a second wheelpit just upstream but it is known that both were not used together. They ceased operation by 1905.\nThe wheels were fed by a reservoir above and a wooden launder (a basic 3-sided chute to run water down) and were of \u0026ldquo;pitch back\u0026rdquo; design, where water was added to the top of the wheel so that it filled buckets and drove the wheel back towards the wooden launder that supplied water. It was found that one reservoir didn\u0026rsquo;t supply enough water as the needs of the quarry grew and a second was added to increase flow.\nHeritage Gateway\tMDV20471 - Northern wheel pit at Meldon Quarry This second wheelpit housed a water wheel some 18 foot in diameter. The walls are better preserved than the first but quite overgrown. Behind it, there is a depression which is a \u0026ldquo;bob-pit\u0026rdquo;. This housed a large counter-weight which kept tension on the flat-rods as they worked to operate the quarry pumps.\nMeldon Viaduct The Meldon Viaduct was built in 1874 by William Galbraith from wrought iron for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to connect Okehampton to Lydford and then on to Plymouth.\nIt was widened to double-track in 1879 by building a second viaduct alongside, this one of steel, and joining the two. This was in service until 1968 when it became yet another victim of the Beeching Cuts. Meldon Quarry continued to use it up until the 1980s for shunting its trains until the track was removed in 1990.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now used by The Granite Way - a shared-use foot, cycle and bridlepath and is a scheduled monument.\nWikipedia - Meldon Viaduct Waste Dumps These are some of the quarry\u0026rsquo;s waste dumps, more properly named as \u0026ldquo;finger dumps\u0026rdquo; for their shape.\nIn the late 1800s the \u0026ldquo;waste\u0026rdquo; was taken in trucks to a series of corrugated iron buildings at the northern end of the east side tramway. A transfer shed was used where the finished material was consigned to wagons operating on an incline leading to the London and South Western Rail sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct. This incline becomes apparent as an earthwork partially obscuring the mouth of the early lime kiln. The crushed stone was used as ballast on railways and roads across the country and any unsuitable stone ended up here.\nHeritage Gateway MDV120325 - Tramway routes at Meldon Limestone Quarry Meldon Pool This old limestone quarry, now flooded. It was used to dig a special Carbonifereous period limestone, not found anywhere else on Dartmoor, and much prized for producing lime.\nThe pool is about 130 feet deep, and when worked was kept drained by pumps driven by the water wheels earlier on our walk. This makes it deeper than the viaduct is high, that being a mere 120 foot tall at its highest span.\nA hundred years ago this site will have been very noisy and busy, with explosions and cranes operating, horse drawn carts rumbling around and men shouting. There will also have been rock crushers and stamps running within earshot, as well as steam trains going over the railway.\nHeritage Gateway MDV4826 - Meldon Lime Works The limestone quarry was smaller in 1841 with various buildings around it that disappeared as the quarry became larger. Beyond the buildings, an inclined plane can be seen extending northwards to take stone to the kiln.\nWeigh House The Weigh House was ruined, but during 2019 was being rebuilt.\nHeritage Gateway MDV120246 - Weigh House and weighbridge south of the Meldon Viaduct The carts of finished stone were weighed here before leaving for the railway. The design would have been similar to modern weighbridges and these metal grids formed the top layer of weighing scales that were read from within the weigh house. The quarry will have recorded its output using these figures, and from that set prices charged and paid.\nGrace\u0026rsquo;s Guide to British Industrial History - Barlett \u0026amp; Son Lime Kiln This lime kiln was built between 1880 and 1885.\nLime was made in the kiln by setting alternating layers of limestone and charcoal made from coppiced hazel trees. Once the kiln was filled to the brim, the fire was lit and everything burned at a high temperature for three days, leaving behind quicklime, Calcium Oxide.\nSlaked lime can be made, carefully, from lime by adding water. This process is called hydration and as the reaction is exothermic, a huge amount of heat is produced and this can be extremely dangerous. Quicklime was so named from the old word \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;alive\u0026rdquo;, as it acted like it was alive when water was added as it churned and boiled.\nOnce made, quick and slaked lime have many uses:\nAgriculture: Increases the PH level of fields by being spread in powder form, transforming acidic soils into sweeter and more productive ground. Construction: Lime Mortar has long been used for building, and is favoured even today for stone buildings instead of cement mortars, as it can move and even heal small cracks as it absorbs moisture. It\u0026rsquo;s also used as limewash for painting, and lime render to cover and stabilise walls. Manufacturing: Lime is used for all sorts of things, including paper, steel, sugar, paint and other processes. Medicine: In the right conditions, lime is also a disinfectant, and is used in purification methods. Under the viaduct The Railway was extended as a single track as far as Lydford in 1874 and this involved building the viaduct, spanning the river for 165 metres.\nThrough this gate and to the left is an early lime kiln.\nTo the right is a bank that supported a tramway to the gate for bringing out old waste from the finger dumps, and down ahead is the Turbine House.\nThe possible crushing house feature (seen below) is just out of sight on the right in this image\nThis is the earlier kiln, built before an Okehampton Estate map of 1790 and originally serving a small nearby quarry. It became disused but was used again when the Meldon Pool quarry started up.\nThis is earliest building in the valley to exploit the local geology. The view is partially blocked by an inclined tramway that took quarried stone up to the railway viaduct, which was built in 1874.\nHeritage Gateway MDV120326 - Site of crushing sheds at Meldon Limestone Quarry This wall may be part of the crushing house where waste was brought from the finger dumps to be crushed and taken past the kiln by tramway up to sidings for use as ballast on the railways, but this is not certain as little is recorded about it.\nTurbine House Water was piped from the Red-a-ven brook to a turbine housed in this building, generating power for the quarry. Spent water was then released into a short brick-lined channel on the West side of the building to return to the brook.\nDevon \u0026amp; Dartmoor HER - MDV120311 - Turbine building at Meldon Quarries My guess from this base and similar designs is that this was a horizontal turbine with a pelton wheel with one or more jets coming in from the side to power them. A central shaft would then have transferred power into a generator mounted directly above it \u0026ndash;Simon\nSomewhere near to the turbine house there were once corrugated iron buildings that housed crushers. These worked previous spoil heaps, crushing limestone which was then loaded onto wagons on an incline that led to the railway sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct.\nExplosives Magazine This stone ruin was once where explosives for the quarry were kept. Before each shift, the explosives handler would take only enough from here for that shift\u0026rsquo;s operation.\nSuch handlers were often selected from the most careful and thorough of the workers, and would avoid carrying any iron tools, or even removed iron hobnails from their boots to reduce the chance of sparks.\nAlthough the walls are strong, explosives stores often had very weak roofs - typically made of stick and oilcloth. If there was an accident, then the force would be sent upwards instead of outwards and repairs to the building would therefore be relatively quick.\nThis ground anchor looks very similar to those used through the 20th century to secure straining wires for telegraph and electricity poles. It was probably employed for a similar purpose here.\nMineshaft There are mine shafts on the east bank of the river with two adits nearby, typical of tin mining. They exist as sub-circular hollows with rims of upcast soil on their downslope margins. They vary in diameter, most examples being in the area of 3 metres with one exceptional example of 6 metres.\nDevon \u0026amp; Dartmoor HER - MDV120322 - Mine shafts east of Meldon Pool This pit is part of a old tin-working gert running down towards the river. The gert ends at SX 56589 92163 where a spoil heap starts and ends closer to the river at SX 56562 92171, quite high above the surrounding ground.\nThe Bottle Factory These modern buildings are associated with more recent quarrying after 1921. The site remained open for a further fifty years until around 1970 and provided stone for road metalling.\nBefore these buildings, there was a failed glass bottle operation on this site.\nFrom the late 19th century, investigations were being made concerning the production of granulite (a granular metamorphic rock) at Meldon. There seemed to be potential to establish both glass and china works at the site.\nThere was little activity until 1920 when a syndicate from London decided to build a glass factory. Two furnaces were installed out of a planned 12, and about 500 men were required. However, by February 1921, the men had been laid off and new owners were being sought.\nNo obvious features remain of a glass industry, but large amounts of broken glass fragments can be seen, mostly representing small medicine and cosmetic bottles. \u0026ndash; (Western Morning News 29/03/1920\nSouth Quarry Here we can see the darker aplite disappearing into the ground, with the less desired striped chirt, similar to that at Meldon Pool.\nMeldon Dam Meldon Dam was begun in 1970 and completed in 1974, making it the newest of Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s large dams.\nIt is 55 meters (180 feet) high.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s 200 meters (660 feet) wide.\nThe reservoir is stocked with Brown Trout for licenced angling.\nUniquely, Meldon reservoir became the first water-supply body to produce electricity when a 500kW turbine generator was installed in 1987 to produce electricity to work the pumps and treatment works.\nWikipedia - Meldon Dam\nAt each end of the dam are these structures. They are used to check the dam\u0026rsquo;s alignment and curvature to ensure there is no movement.\nThis spillway appears to be a combination of a straight chute and stepped spillway features. These are designed to reduce the kinetic energy of overflowing water and thereby reduce erosion damage. This system is essentially an uncontrolled system in that there are no mechanical gates or vanes to regulate the rate of overflow at the top of the dam.\nMany of these plaques on Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s reservoirs were made of bronze and have been stolen in recent years for their scrap value. Hopefully this one does not appear to the thieves.\nOnce across the dam, we are back at the car park and our walk is complete\nParking Parking is at the Meldon Reservoir site, which is Pay and Display. It also has toilet facilities and an electric car charging point.\nReferences Mintek Resources - Lime Peter Keane (2007), Exploring a Dartmoor Valley: The Meldon Beneath Our Feet Mike Brown (2001) Guide to Dartmoor, CD-ROM, Dartmoor Press ","date":"2024-12-18T00:00:00Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/meldon-and-the-west-okemont-valley/16_hu_2177ba67837f724.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/meldon-and-the-west-okemont-valley/","title":"Meldon and the West Okemont Valley"},{"content":"Information Distance: 4 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words mornings.cement.regret Map Widecombe Village The name Widecombe is from \u0026ldquo;Withy or Willow Valley\u0026rdquo;, a Saxon name.

However, her descriptions of Dartmoor Life during the early twentieth century are without doubt very important from a historical perspective, and her passion for Dartmoor was no lie. She was also involved in the First World War effort, creating the \u0026ldquo;Knights of the White Crusade\u0026rdquo; - a movement to encourage all servicemen to be \u0026ldquo;Pure and noble\u0026rdquo;. She also campaigned against Dartmoor being turned into a National Park, and against its use as a Military training ground. Clearly a lady of strong opinions.\nBeatrice Chase - Wikipedia Widecombe Church Dominating the village is the medieval Church of St. Pancras which dates from the late 1300, although there is a list of vicars which goes back to 1253 for the Village. It\u0026rsquo;s sometimes called The Cathedral Of The Moor due to it being so imposing, and also as it\u0026rsquo;s the biggest Church on Dartmoor. The 120ft tower was added in the 1400 or early 1500\u0026rsquo;s through the benevolence of the tinners\u0026rsquo; Guild of St Pancras.\nNamed after a Roman boy, Pancratius, martyred under Emperor Diocletian in 304 AD.\nThe church was badly damaged in the Great Thunderstorm of 1638, apparently struck by ball lightning.

The abandoned quarries have been retaken by nature despite having been worked as recently as 1966. The quarries once supported an entire village of based here at Foggintor, with a School, Chapel and 30 cottages. The landscape will have looked very differently here two hundred years ago at the height of its industry. Now only evocative ruins remain.\nThe Mission Hall Across the road from the parking area are the ruins of the old non-denominational Mission Hall, built in 1887 and demolished in 1965.\nDue to problems at Foggintor school, the Mission Hall opened as a school on 17th August 1896 to house 41 pupils and soon that grew to 95 children. The school closed on 27th September 1912 and the children went to temporary schools at Merrivale and back to Foggintor Chapel until the new school opened at what is now known as Four Winds, on 19th April 1915.\nIn the photograph above, Great Mis Tor is seen at top right.\nDartmoor Explorations has some photographs of how the mission hall looked We start our walk by following the track away from the road to the South\nRed Cottages This leat still supplies Yellowmeade and formerly ran on to supply Foggintor. It is probable that the cottages were supplied by a bullseye stone to regulate water use.\nThe cottages stood on the high ground on the left of the photograph (but to the right of the track) and were separated from their gardens by a back lane. The cottages were planned in 1846 and built by April 1849. They were probably demolished in 1953, the same year as Hill Cottages.\nAccording to various Censuses, they were originally known as Mount Pleasant Cottages, then West View Cottages, and after that, Red Cottages.\nThey were built with cob and by 1871 the weather got into them so badly they were \u0026ldquo;covered with corrugated iron\u0026rdquo; and painted with red lead, thus becoming known as Red Cottages - this appears in the 1871 Census.\nKath Brewer writes in \u0026ldquo;The Railways, Quarries and Cottages of Foggintor\u0026rdquo; that in later years they were actually black, having been covered with pitch, again against the weather.\nThere were six cottages but with twelve dwellings - with \u0026ldquo;one up, one down\u0026rdquo;. In the 1861 Census, there were thirteen families with 50 adults and 38 children at West View, as the cottages were known at that time.\nLarge weighted iron bars were used to drill the granite to take the explosive charge. These drills, known as Jumpers, were tested here to ensure they were sharp enough.\nYellowmeade The \u0026ldquo;lumps and bumps\u0026rdquo; in the background are waste tips of Foggintor Quarry.\nYellowmeade Farm itself was not established until 1860, the last farm to be founded in Walkhampton Parish. It was enclosed by George Cole whose family lived there until about 2015.\nFurther on we\u0026rsquo;ll see clear evidence of worked trackway blocks, proving this track was also once a horse-drawn railway.\nSett Making A quarryman once stood at this point making Setts.\nSetts are granite blocks that were much used for paving roads and paths, and can still be seen in many cities, for they last a very long time.\nRough cut setts blocks be brought here, such as cut from the Cake Stone above. To cut down on transport, the bankers typically set up very close by to the raw material, and their workplaces - bankers - were rough and ready; somewhere to stand and work the stone at around waist level.\nIn exposed conditions, and this certainly qualifies, they would erect shelters to keep off the rain, snow and the worst of the wind. These would have been made of oilskin tarpaulin with a stick framework, probably on three sides, backed to the wind.\nThe tools were iron chisels and a hammer, with the working stone set on a bed on firm earth and granite chips, which would absorb the blows.\nIt was a hard job. As well as the obvious difficulties of weather and repetitive, physical work; the sett-maker\u0026rsquo;s hearing will have suffered and worse, many will have suffered from silicosis from working granite and died early from lung problems.\nThe stone here is the waste rock - where setts failed, often through cracks in the rock or where edges were trimmed off.\nTraditional stonemasons still work very similarly to this, but now have tungsten tipped chisels and, when working with granite, a full-face respirator system.\nWhen I worked for DNPA in the late 1980s, they often employed a traditional stonemason who would work just inside the entrance of the Works Depot in Bovey Tracey. He had a 45 gallon oil drum full of granite chips on which he\u0026rsquo;d place his work, which might be a perfectly spherical ball to sit atop a gatepost. He\u0026rsquo;d stand there all day, chipping away. Pausing every now and then to offer up a hardboard template to check his progress, or check diameter with a set of large calipers. He wore a full face respirator, with a battery pack and inlet on his belt at the back, similar to those used by industrial welders, which blew filtered air into the mask. \u0026ndash; Simon\nFoggintor Quarry The \u0026ldquo;bumps\u0026rdquo; on the left skyline are high-level waste tips while the enormous waste tip to the right is named \u0026ldquo;Big Tip\u0026rdquo;.\nRoyal Oak Quarry (later known as Foggintor) was worked from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, extracting granite that was taken away on the nearby railway line. This track was a horse-driven rail or tramway, so some deliveries will also have left this way to the road, as well as bringing supplies into the quarry and its accompanying village.\nRemains on the site include ruins of numerous buildings, large spoil tips and tracks, including that leading to the nearby Swell Tor Quarry, was closely associated. Foggintor was known to have included up to 30 cottages, a large Manager\u0026rsquo;s house, smithy, powder house, dressing sheds and stables.\nThe Quarry was first dug in 1820, then known as Royal Oak Quarry. Through the 1830s through 1840s, up to 600 men were employed by the local quarries, some living at Foggintor and most journeying in each day. In the 1861 Census, 267 people were registered as living at Foggintor. As well as Foggintor, Hill Quarry and Royal Oak Quarry, this was also known as Foggator - probably a local dialect corruption. The Houses of Parliament and Nelson\u0026rsquo;s Column were built from granite taken from this quarry. More locally, stone from here was used to build Tor Royal at Princetown, and likely some other Princetown buildings, although the Prison\u0026rsquo;s stone was mostly dug from the nearer Herne Hole Quarry. Foggintor Quarry was owned at one time by the Johnson Brothers who also took the lease on Haytor Quarry, but closed it and then sold stone from Foggintor Quarry under Haytor\u0026rsquo;s name. The quarry closed in 1966, putting 40 men out of work. One factor given was competition from cheaper sources abroad, and an increasing use of concrete instead of stone in architecture. The stones that form Big Tip are huge, especially on the lower levels. Approaching from the side you can see some must weigh many tons, and cracks in between are big enough to easily conceal an adult. This looks like it might have once been a kistvaen or cist, but could also be a split or worked stone from the sett-makers or even a natural feature.\nThe blocked up gateway above is in the angle at the right of this photo.\nHill Farm Hill Farm, also known as Eva\u0026rsquo;s Farm. The family was at Foggintor on the 1881, 1891 and was still present until at least 1936.\nMethodist Chapel and School Ruins These scant foundations were once a schoolhouse and a Wesleyan Chapel.\nThe quarry workers originally sent their children to the School at Princetown, which was then probably built in the Barracks. But when Dartmoor Prison was re-opened in 1850, a new building for the School was needed and was built here. At its peak in 1861, 183 pupils were known to regularly attend.\nNote that this is not the later \u0026ldquo;Foggintor School\u0026rdquo;. That was also known as Four Winds and forms the large tree-lined car park half a mile south of our parking. We discuss that school in our Merrivale Calendar walk\nBetween 1880 and 1883, this building was also recorded as a Wesleyan Chapel, and later a Workshop and again as a private residence, so it clearly served multiple purposes.\nBy 1915 it was closed forever.\nHeritage Gateway -Methodist chapel / school at Foggintor Quarry Hill Cottages These are believed to have been built in the 1840s. The last resident left in 1951 and they were demolished two years later.\nYou can see where a branch railway line was laid out along Big Tip to carry waste for tipping. The railway gauge was about 2-feet for easy man-handling. It is recorded that only 10% of quarried granite was used in building, the rest was waste. Looking at the size of these tips, it is easy to believe that disposing of waste rock was a large part of the works here.\nMuch of the research for this walk was taken from Kath Brewer\u0026rsquo;s book, The Railways, Quarries and Cottages of Foggintor, Orchard Publications, Chudleigh, Newton Abbot, 1997. The cottage about the arch was her home.\nThe purpose of the arch is unknown. There is a suggestion that a waterwheel was located here, but there seems to be no evidence to support that.\nQuarry Entrance In the foreground of this picture are the remains of a crane base, at SX 56652 73658.\nFor our walk, we circle the quarry clockwise by climbing to the left above the quarry entrance\nThe 1840 Walkhampton Tithe Map shows Little King Tor and Great King Tor. It also shows the 1823 Plymouth \u0026amp; Dartmoor Railway, extended from King Tor quarries to Princetown by December 1826. It shows neither Foggin Tor nor the branch line to Foggintor Quarry. These were active well within Walkhampton Parish, although quarrying had nothing to do with tithing and therefore wasn\u0026rsquo;t suitable for the purpose of the map.\nFollow the level ground back towards Big Tip\nReturn walk It\u0026rsquo;s worth leaving the track after the field enclosures to walk below it, as per our route on the map, for some interesting historical items\nThis hut is labelled \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; in the figure below. Cairn 1 is a ruined cisted cairn. The area around Yellowmeade was occupied in Bronze Age times.\nParking There is a fair layby at the start of the track to Yellowmeade and Foggintor - which is in fact an old sand quarry. Please don\u0026rsquo;t block the track, it is in regular use.\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s full, there\u0026rsquo;s usually some space opposite, and some more a short way towards Princetown by the old pump house.\nReferences John Hallett (1994), Around Princetowns Quarries: The Tyrwhitt Railway Trail from Princetown.

The views to the West are nice and there\u0026rsquo;s a little history along the way.\nThe walk is mostly on a stone track. Although dry and firm, some of the stones are loose so care is needed. There\u0026rsquo;s a gradual descent on the way out, and a corresponding climb on the return.\nSurrounded by Tors Bel Tor, on the other side of the hedge, has a Logan Stone, Rock Basins and a Triangulation Pillar. Sadly it is on private land and we cannot visit.\nDr Blackall Dr Thomas Blackwell MD FRCP (1814 - 4th May 1899, aged 85) trained at St George\u0026rsquo;s Hospital, London, and had a practice in Mayfair.\nHe was the youngest son of Dr John Blackall (1771-1860), the sixth son of Rev. Theophilus Blackall, who was a Prebendary (Honorary Canon) of Exeter Cathedral. John Blackall was an eminent physician who trained at St. Bartholomew\u0026rsquo;s Hospital, London, and then returned to Exeter in 1797, settling in Totnes in 1801. When he died in 1860, Thomas, his only surviving son inherited his estate.\nThomas bought the nearby Spitchwick Manor at Poundsgate in 1867. It seems that he never married but according to Censuses from 1861 onwards, there was always a \u0026ldquo;Visitor\u0026rdquo;, A Mrs Julia Tindall, and her daughter Caroline. It was Julia who inherited his estate when he died.\nIn the 1870/1880s, Thomas had the \u0026ldquo;Drive\u0026rdquo; constructed for his pleasure and for visiting guests to enjoy carriage rides driving southwards to enjoy the magnificent views down the River Dart valley.\n(This is disputed by Hemery (1987, p.588) who reports that it was cut \u0026ldquo;a century or so ago\u0026rdquo; by Gerald Warren and his family for Dr Joseph Blackall, of Spitchwick Manor.)\nStumble Corner Mel Tor We can leave the track here at Meltor Corner and make a short detour to the right to visit Mel Tor\nMel Tor is perhaps more accurately named \u0026ldquo;Mil Tor\u0026rdquo;, which is short for \u0026ldquo;Middle Tor\u0026rdquo; as it is twixt Sharp Tor and Hockinston Tor.\nThere is apparently an abandoned millstone near this tor, although we haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to locate it.\nRejoin Blackall\u0026rsquo;s drive and continue to the South\nSlotted Gateposts Note the inverted \u0026ldquo;L\u0026rdquo; slot in the post where timber would have been slid in and dropped forming a solid rail.\nThese slots are usually found five to a side, and form the basis of the \u0026ldquo;5 bar gate\u0026rdquo; phrase.\nElsewhere they are called \u0026ldquo;Slip gates\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Stang Stoops\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Yatsteads\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Hinge and L\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Stand Pole Gateways\u0026rdquo; being a common form of simple, but secure, gate.\nThere is a good Wikipedia Article showing some fine examples.\nThey were prone to damage at the ends of the rails and gradually fell out of use as iron became more available for hinges.\nHigher Uppacott is a Grade 1 listed longhouse from the early 14th century and is notable as its shippon has survived unchanged.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now owned by the Dartmoor National Park and was restored in 2018 as part of the Moor than Meets the Eye project.\nThere used to be a custom that involved the rolling of wooden wagon wheels down the hill of Mil Tor to the River Dart on Midsummer Day, but it fell into disuse during WW2.\nThe practice was revived for a time in the late 1950s but not for long. The idea was to roll them down the 600-foot hill but the rock-strewn nature of the ground stopped most of them.\nToday, the rusting iron tyres lie around in the wood, some with trees now growing up through them. Hemery p.589\nAish Tor This is metamorphic bedrock formed approximately 318 to 328 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period. Originally formed as sedimentary rocks in swamps, estuaries and deltas to form slates. Later altered by low-grade metamorphism i.e. heating during geologic processes such as the nearby intrusion of Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s molten magma (granite).\nThis cairn seems to sit on a raised circular hump of ground that might be an earlier cairn or kist, although this is unverified.\nThis may not be Aish Tor at all - the exact location seems disputed, and certainly indistinct. Not perhaps the most impressive of Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Tors.\nWe must now retrace our steps back to the car park\nWhilst it is tempting to walk the road back to the start to make this a circular walk, the road is narrow and traffic often heavy. It\u0026rsquo;s surely nicer to retrace our steps and admire the view from a different angle.\nYou may have noticed this on the way down as it\u0026rsquo;s beside the track. This is part of the ancient Bronze Age Mel Tor farmstead and enclosure, dating back around four thousand years.\nHeritage Gateway MDV6453 - Settlement east of Mel Tor\nParking Bell Tor Car park is free and right off the road.

The bedrock was laid down as sedimant in open seas about 359 to 383 million years ago.\nYennadon Stone is the last active stone quarry still working on moorland Dartmoor, out of scores that once existed.\nIron Mine \u0026ldquo;In 1836 Ralph Lopes leased the area to George Stone Baron to \u0026lsquo;dig work mine and search for Iron, Iron Ore, Iron Stone and all other Ores\u0026rsquo; on what was then called Great Yennadon Common, the rent being 1s 8d in the on the gross value according to the price on the day of all such ores metals and minerals which shall be \u0026hellip; digged raised and gotten out of from or in the said premises\u0026rdquo;\nThere was no lease following this, so it must be concluded the venture was unsuccessful. In 1846, another license was issued to other adventurers!\nWW2 Searchlight Battery This searchlight was operational from 9 Feb. 1944. It would help protect Plymouth, Burrator Reservoir and RAF Harrowbeer at Yelverton.\nAll that remains now are the outlines of a row of four huts, of which only one has anything obvious.\nClapper Bridge Steam Railway The first railway, the 1823 horse-drawn PDR of Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt has already been mentioned.\nThe second railway was the 1883 [Princetown Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princetown_Railway0 (using steam locomotives) that replaced it, runnning from Yelverton to Princetown.\nThis one connected with the 1859 South Devon and Tavistock Railway Company (SD\u0026amp;TR) Plymouth-Tavistock line. It was adopted by the GWR from 1st January 1922 and closed March 3rd, 1956.\nThe horse-drawn tramway consisted of short wagons that could be pulled in quite a tight turn. The line enters this image at the far right, from the gateway seen above, swings around a hairpin bend (kindly marked by the sheep) and doubles back towards the camera at the left, from where it goes through the first gate above up to Iron Mine Lane and on to Princetown via the west side of the Down.\nThe steam railway could not turn a tight bend like this and was built running into this image at the bottom left and on into the distance towards the reservoir where it ran around the flank of the Down above the dam to Burrator \u0026amp; Sheepstor Halt and then on to Princetown, travelling up the east side of the Down.\nCattle Creep These \u0026ldquo;creeps\u0026rdquo; (simply small tunnels) were installed at intervals along the railway to enable livestock to cross underneath the railway which would have been fenced along its route to keep livestock from entering the tracks.\nBronze Age Hut Circle Bench with a view \u0026ldquo;One of the boundary stones which marked the sett has in fact survived, the existence of which had been overlooked by previous Dartmoor explorers and writers until I discovered it some years ago.

This was a major industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries employing hundreds of people, and many ruins and reminders remain. The main route is firm and easy going, with a gentle hill on the final climb back to the car park.\nNote: The track along the valley, although firm underfoot, is often very wet all year round. Sensible footwear recommended.\nDo feel free to explore the area and leave our track - there are many points of interest, some of which we\u0026rsquo;ve marked on the map and all are worth exploring.\nThe Four Aces From the parking, on a clear day, you can see three rock walled enclosures across the valley. Together with a fourth (see map, central), these are known as the \u0026ldquo;Four Aces\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The Devil\u0026rsquo;s Playing Cards\u0026rdquo;.\nLegend tells\u0026hellip; Jan Reynolds was a tin miner from Widecombe who was more interested in drinking and gambling than in going to church on a Sunday. Finding himself short of money he made a deal with the Devil: in return for money to fund his gambling the Devil could have his soul if he was found asleep in church.\nJan soon forgot the pact and one Sunday he fell asleep while playing cards in church. There was a sound of horses’ hooves outside, and a flash of lightning so fierce that it tore off the top of the church tower, then the Devil strode into the church and snatched up the terrified miner, carrying him up into the sky and across the moor. Jan had four aces in his hand and he dropped them in what is now known as the Aces Field.\nOne can quite clearly see a diamond shape, but it taxes the imagination to see the shape of a Heart, a Club and a Spade in these fields.\nThe reality of these enclosures is that they were either to keep rabbits in or rabbits out. The farm just over the hill to the Easy is Headland Warren Farm, which was known to breed rabbits which formed a large part of the miner\u0026rsquo;s diet. I\u0026rsquo;m unclear whether the rabbits were kept in these enclosures, or they were built for growing crops which needed protecting.\nTake the path Eastwards into the valley for about half a mile\nVitifer Mine Also known as Vityfer\nMany of the paths in this area are formed of growan - decomposed granite - which makes for good walking.\nThis area contains the remains of four distinct mines:\nVitifer (Prev: Vytifer) Mine Birch Tor Mine Easy Birch Tor Mine (AKA Headland Mine) Golden Dagger Mine. Vitifer and Birch Tor were separate mines originally, then combined, then separated, and then combined again. Naming of these two seems interchangeable, with both workings being known by both names.\nThe chimney was between the blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s shop and the miners\u0026rsquo; dry - and the wall of the carpenter\u0026rsquo;s shop at extreme left, with Challacombe Down behind.\nThe flue here runs underneath and heated what was the \u0026ldquo;Miner\u0026rsquo;s dry\u0026rdquo; - a place where miners would hang their clothes, soaked from working underground in dripping and partially flooded adits and stopes.\nA fireplace or boiler would have been placed at the far end of the flue, and the smoke run through it to the chimney, which released it high enough not to bother those at ground level.\nThe turbine house does not appear in the 1904 OS map, so was likely built after that.\nThese mines were powered mostly by water, by the Birch Tor and Vitifer Mine Leat which travelled for 7 miles.\nLarge waterwheels were used here for pumping out water, raising ore from shafts and driving the crushing stamps.\nSmaller waterwheels were used for other work, such as driving the \u0026ldquo;sweeps\u0026rdquo; that swept the crushed ore on the buddles at the lower edge of the workings.\nGolden Dagger Mine This mine was named after a bronze dagger was found here from the early men who lived here four thousand years ago.\nThe dagger was taken to Plymouth Museum, and rumoured to have been destroyed during World War 2 bombing of that building.\nA replica dagger is owned by DNPA and can sometimes be seen at their information centres and displays.\nThis area was mined for Tin from at least the fifteenth century via surface streaming.\nMines were dug to chase tin further underground from around the 1750s. Given the amount of surface water in this area, one imagines these were very wet mines and hard to keep dewatered.\nThe underground workings ended in 1914 when many men were drafted for the First World War. Some surface working remained until 1939 when again, the needs of war took labour away from the moors.\nDinah\u0026rsquo;s House This building was so named because Dinah Hext and her children lived here in 1860s and 1870s, having moved a short way up the valley from Challacombe.\n\u0026ldquo;CEH 1832\u0026rdquo; in cement on lower side, southern end of the house. It was also apparently once a dormitory (Called a \u0026ldquo;barracks\u0026rdquo;) and meeting place for miners.\nEngine House Center: Petter Engine (The Lister-Petter company is still in business today) Gas Engine (Extreme Right) Gas producing plant (center distant) A Magnetic Separator was left of the camera A winter turbine generator was right of the camera A summer generator was beyond the Petter Engine Buddle A buddle is a simple structure to separate material out by its density.\nFine sediment is introduced at the centre point by trough or pipe in suspension with water. As it flows towards the outer edge, heavier material is deposited first.\nSome buddles are assisted by rotary brushes.\nOnce sufficient sediment has built up, it is shovelled out with the \u0026ldquo;headings\u0026rdquo; containing the more valuable minerals in the centre, and the less valuable or waste known as \u0026ldquo;tailings\u0026rdquo; towards the edge.\nThis one is known to have been fed by a slurry onto the cone by a small leat arrangement and swept by a waterwheel-driven \u0026ldquo;wood and rags sweeps\u0026rdquo;\nThis is the far point of our walk - we must return along the same track and view the workings from a different angle\nParking There is hard parking at the given coordinates which lead directly into our walk.\nReferences Dartefacts Dartmoor Trust Archive Heritage Gateway - Birch Tor and Vitifer Mines - Golden Dagger Mine Old Maps Some of the old maps showing the layout of these mines in busier times.\nOS 25-inch Single Sheet map 1885/1886 - red buildings OS 25-inch map 1892-1914 Series - showing Warren House Inn, Birch Tor \u0026amp; Vitifer Tin Mine and Golden DaggerTin Mine OS 25-inch Single Sheet map Surv.1885/Publ.1886 - old detail of Vitifer, Birch Tor and Golden Dagger Mines ","date":"2024-12-09T17:20:03Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/vitifer-and-golden-dagger-mines/27_hu_c6e478b38b3f400d.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/vitifer-and-golden-dagger-mines/","title":"Vitifer and Golden Dagger Mines"},{"content":"Information Distance: 4 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words keeps.plug.ambitions Map Introduction A walk including some hills through Haytor and historic quarries from previous centuries. Points of interest include abandoned machinery, the Haytor Granite Tramway (The Templer Way), an abandoned partially-carved apple crusher and ruined buildings including a \u0026lsquo;beehive\u0026rsquo; quarryman\u0026rsquo;s hut.\nWe start from the Upper Haytor car park, marked on the map as the lower P and white/green cross. Walk upwards towards the imposing Haytor\nHaytor Haytor The name is a cartographer\u0026rsquo;s corruption of the local name of High Tor, pronounced in the Dartmoor dialect as \u0026ldquo;Hey Tor\u0026rdquo;.\nThese are granite intrusions that are seen from a long way off, even from The English Channel, and are hence, the \u0026ldquo;high tor\u0026rdquo;.\nWith rock piles separated by an area of grass, it is also called an \u0026ldquo;avenue tor\u0026rdquo;. Other Avenue Tors are Bellever Tor, Hound Tor, Great Staple (or, originally, Steeple) Tor, Rippon Tor, and Pew Tor.\nRock climbers and abseilers use Haytor often.\nOn special occasions, a bonfire is sometimes set on the exposed flat rocks of Low Man by the local community in agreement with the local Authority and Landowner. These celebration fires, which have likely occured for millenia, can be seen for a huge distance.\nOn the very top of Low Man is a hole drilled by the Victorians to hold a flagpole.\nThe Victorians also carved steps into Haytor and erected a wrought-iron handrail to help them climb the rock with more ease. The steps, somewhat weathered, still exist, but only stubs of the ironwork remain. Stairs and a similar handrail still exist at Blackingstone Rock.\nThe adventurous may wish to climb Haytor. You will find the steps up the shallower grade, with a small leap across to the main rock.\nThis is not an easy climb and advised only for the fit and agile with suitable footwear, and to be avoided by all in icy or windy weather for obvious reasons.\nFor our walk, we turn right in front of Haytor and head Northeast for about 500m\nHaytor Quarry At the fence, follow it down to the right until you come into a small gate where you may enter the quarry.\nThis crane would have been used to lift blocks of rough-cut granite out of the quarry below, and also on and off wheeled trams for transport down the Haytor Granite Tramway for loading onto barges at Stover, and then by boat to Teignmouth for transport internationally.\nNotably, granite from this quarry was used in many fine London buildings including Nelson\u0026rsquo;s Column and London Bridge.\nDNPA infosheet on Granite Quarry and the Haytor Granite Tramway - including sketch of how this crane would once looked The Templer Family These quarries were started in 1813 by a George Templer (1781-1843), who also build the Haytor Granite Tramway.\nGeorge\u0026rsquo;s father, James Templer II (1748-1813) built Stover Canal nearby, which was originally used to transport Ball Clay from the Bovey Basin to factories worldwide, including those used for Wedgewood Porcelain. The Stover canal was later also used for the export of stone from here.\nGeorge\u0026rsquo;s grandfather, James Templer (1722-1782) built Stover House\nUnfortunately, George overspent and he was forced to sell the family estate; Stover House, Stover Canal and the Haytor Granite Tramway. These were bought by Edward St Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset - \u0026ldquo;Lord Seymour\u0026rdquo; (1775-1855)\nAt that time, Haytor quarries were leased by the Johnson Brothers in 1840, who closed them within a few years. It is known they were having problems with \u0026ldquo;the Union\u0026rdquo; and it seems likely this was linked. The brothers also leased Foggintor quarries and sold stone from there under the Haytor Granite Company name, which was misleading to customers as the Haytor granite was known to be of better quality.\nSeven years later, the Haytor lease was up for renewal and the Duke refused to extend it, but the quarry never re-opened.\nThe crane was still functional in 1946 and a photograph taken in 1964 shows it still standing.\nHeritage Gateway page MDV43350 - Machinery at Haytor Quarries The lilies, and the goldfish and occasional koi you may see, were introduced well after the closing of the quarries.\nSwimming is not advised!\nAs well as hidden hazards underwater, there are a great many leeches in these ponds! If you study the water edges you may see them wriggling.\nIn 1986, as part of a Youth Training Scheme (YTS), I was part of a group of youths who carried water barrels, rope and pallets up to these quarries. We were tasked, as part of a confidence-building course run by Torbay Council, to build a raft and cross this pit.

A much larger example can be found at Foggintor Quarry.\nHaytor Granite Tramway The gauge of the track is 4 foot 3 inches (1295mm) with the rails being shaped granite blocks.\nNote that because there were no flanges, the inner part of the rails is of differing heights and hasn\u0026rsquo;t been as carefully worked - because it only existed to steer the wheels back onto the lower, flatter, part.\nThis Haytor Tramway wagon is kept at the DNPA Head Office at Parke, Bovey Tracey.\nThe wagons were connected together in \u0026rsquo;trains\u0026rsquo; of 12 or so, drawn by a team of 18 or 19 horses in single file.\nThe horses were placed behind the train going down when they provided much needed braking, and in front of the train when pulling the empty wagons back to the quarries.\n\u0026#34;Nineteen stout horses it was known, From Holwell Quarry drew the stone, And mounted on twelve-wheeled car \u0026#39;Twas safely brought from Holwell Tor\u0026#34; -- Thomas Taverner At junctions the wheels were guided by \u0026lsquo;point tongues\u0026rsquo;, pivoted on the granite-block rails.\nThis could be described as an early form of a railway \u0026ldquo;switchplate\u0026rdquo;. Authorities differ on whether the point tongues were oak or iron.\nThis is Holwell Junction on the tramway, looking back the way we\u0026rsquo;ve come.\nThe left branch leads to Haytor Quarry whilst straight ahead leads to Holwell Quarry, Rubble Heap Quarry, Harrow Barrow Quarry and Haytor West Quarry.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll return here shortly, but for now, continue downhill for a hundred meters.\nA set of \u0026ldquo;going nowhere\u0026rdquo; points at SX 75795 77772. Some of these branches are not shown on the old 1886 map (surveyed in 1885).\nIt can only be assumed these were cut for a future line or quarry that was never constructed, for they clearly hold no purpose.\nFor now, turn around and return to Holwell Junction, and carry straight on to the West.\nRubble Heap Junction Rubble Heap Junction: straight on leads to Rubble Heap Quarry, Harrow Barrow and West Quarries. Right turns down to Holwell Quarry.\nBear right here to Holwell Quarry.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;d like a shorter walk, you can continue ahead and skip the Holwell Quarry visit\nHolwell Quarry This carving was the base for an apple mill used for cider making.\nOne can imagine the frustration of the carver when it broke. It\u0026rsquo;s not known whether it broke in the carving, or was damaged in transport.\nThere are five separate quarries on Haytor Down: Haytor (Main) Quarry, Holwell Quarry, Rubble Heap Quarry, Harrow Barrow (Emsworthy East Quarry) and Western Quarry (Emsworthy West Quarry).\n\u0026ldquo;Emsworthy\u0026rdquo; names are sometimes used because of the proximity of Emsworthy (Hemsworthy) Rocks, between Haytor and Saddle Tor.\nBeehive This can be found a short way below the tramway near to its end.\nThe hut is known locally as \u0026ldquo;The Beehive\u0026rdquo; due to its conical shape, and was possibly used as an explosives store, or a shelter during blasting.\nWe now return back up the track to Rubble Heap Junction and turn right\nContinuing along the tramway to the Southwest for around 300 meters until you find;\nRubble Heap Quarry From here, we return to the quarry entrance and walk towards Haytor across open moorland\nTo finish the walk, descend down to the Higher car park where we started\nParking This walk starts from the upper Haytor car park, which is Pay and Display.

There is a huge amount of unique history here that cannot fail to make one pause and wonder. Stone rows, stone circles, carved granite and a school for the children of the quarryworkers at nearby Foggintor.\nParking Park at the coordinates above, which is also SX 560 748. An isolated spot surrounded by trees on the B3357 road between the Dartmoor Inn, at Merrivale, and the turnoff to Princetown on the road to Two Bridges. This is marked by the yellow cross and the the P symbol on the map.\nLeave the car park due west, running parallel to the road.\nApple Crusher The round object in the left foreground is often described as an abandoned runner, that is, the running wheel, that would be turned on an axle pulled by a horse with the stone running in a circular trough crushing apples for making cider: i.e. an abandoned apple crusher.\nHowever, that is not accurate\u0026hellip;\nIn 1905, the Western Morning News and other papers published a story about this stone, claiming it was a buried quoit or dolmen with a worked capstone.\nWe can be fairly sure that this report was inaccurate thanks to William Crossing, who wrote in Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Early History \u0026amp; Medieval remains, Chap 12\neventually a man was found before any scientific paper was written who pronounced: \u0026ldquo;Twadn\u0026rsquo;t no old man cut thacky stone,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;I cut\u0026rsquo;n.\u0026rdquo; This is an abandoned top-stone to a crazing mill, an old way of grinding tin ore before it was smelted.\nMerrivale Quarry In the distance we can see Merrivale Quarry.\nWilliam Duke opened this as \u0026ldquo;Tor Quarry\u0026rdquo; in 1876, its operations absorbing the old sett-making craft previously carried out under the Staple Tors.\nAs well as cutting setts, Granite from this quarry was also used for Gravestones, agricultural rollers and the like. It also provided the facing for the New Scotland Yard building in London.\nThe quarry closed in 1997, spending its final years dressing imported stone from Norway.\nThe name \u0026ldquo;Merrivale\u0026rdquo; for this part of Walkhampton Common is said to derive from \u0026ldquo;mara val\u0026rdquo; in old Cornish, meaning \u0026ldquo;plague market\u0026rdquo;. This is thought to have been corrupted from \u0026ldquo;tin market\u0026rdquo;, although \u0026ldquo;potato market\u0026rdquo; has also been suggested.\nIn times of the Black Death (1348-1353: when 50 million people died in Europe (Not to be confused with the Great Plague of London, 1665-1666), farmers left food here for Tavistock people who left coins as payment soaking in vinegar to clean them of the badness.\n\u0026ldquo;Mar val\u0026rdquo; has also been interpreted as Mirey Vale.\nHeritage Gateway article for this hut circle Both stone rows are double - that is consisting of two rows of stones about a meter apart. This row has the ruins of a cairn, ring cairn or cairn circle associated with this end. (The ring of stones)\nThe double nature of the row is seen well here. The first, larger, stone in the row casts its shadow quite symmetrically onto the blocking stone at mid-winter solstice.\nLong Ash Leat is seen at the very bottom of the photograph and Roos Tor, SX 543 766, elevation 454 metres (1489 feet) on the skyline. Shillapark Farm is in the middle distance.\n\u0026ldquo;Cist\u0026rdquo; comes from \u0026ldquo;Kistvaen - a stone coffin, from the Celtic cist, a chest, and maen, stone, \u0026lsquo;v\u0026rsquo; being used as a mutation of \u0026rsquo;m\u0026rsquo;.\u0026rdquo; .

Merrivale ceremonial centre (Figs. 44.1-44.10), page 30\nMenhir Celtic (maen = stone + hir = long i.e. \u0026rsquo;longstone\u0026rsquo;). The function of this stone has been suggested in Dartmoor Sun as a midwinter sunset marker when viewed from a leaning stone at SX 55461 74683.\nLong Ash Pits Early, possibly medieval or even earlier, tin workings where tinners collected alluvial deposits along stream beds.\nThe eroded tin ore could form quite pure tin gravel in such areas, having been washed down from the surrounding granite.\nThe early tinners \u0026ldquo;leated\u0026rdquo; water to a trench at the lower end of the ground, called a \u0026rsquo;tye\u0026rsquo; and water was used to wash away the lighter \u0026lsquo;gangue\u0026rsquo; gravels.\nThis method left banks of waste behind. The area is surrounded by a scarp that shows the original level of the land and the depth of the deposits.\nTin streaming was often followed by open cast mining to go deeper, into big cuttings called \u0026ldquo;gerts\u0026rdquo;, but this is not seen here.\nIt was presumably this water source that was diverted and used for washing away the lighter sediments so as to leave the heavier tin-bearing gravels and sands for smelting. This would have been among the earliest tin-extraction methods.\nThis photograph also shows the scarp surrounding this area that suggests how much the early tinners changed the look of the landscape.\nPackhorse Trail In the photograph above, a portion of the pillar has been enhanced to show the \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; more clearly, facing towards Ashburton.\nIn the Middle Ages,this trading route was very important, especially for wool and cloth or yarn, going via Sheepstor - which was famed for its sheep and wool.\nThe track was superseded by the turnpike road in 1792.\nStrangers to the moor often had to tackle this high lonely route, this section over the Princetown area was the highest part and the most exposed. Princetown, or Thomas Tyrwhitt\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Prince\u0026rsquo;s Town\u0026rdquo;, did not exist in those days.\nGuide posts were erected along the way and what we see today are possibly the more \u0026lsquo;modern\u0026rsquo; (1669) improved series, which were sponsored by Plymouth Corporation at the princely sum of £2.\nClapper Bridge This picture features a \u0026ldquo;pinch\u0026rdquo; stile that was to keep sheep out of the old school grounds, but allowing access to a path over the small clapper bridge crossing the Long Ash Leat.\nThis leat was built in the 1880s to take water Long Ash.\nFour Winds School Four Winds was the site of Foggintor School, built 1914, opened April 1915 with 55 children from the nearby cottages associated with Foggintor and other quarries.\nMr \u0026amp; Mrs Stoyle were the teachers, it was a spacious building with a wood block floor and central heating - the pipes were used for warming their pasties.\nThere were periods of closure due to snow and whooping cough. The garden had bees, poultry, a goat and rabbits.\nBesides the school building there was also School House, for the teachers. One section of the enclosure was the playing field.\nThe school was run throughout its history by Fred Stoyle, the youngest head-teacher in the country.\nTheir son, Ivan, planted the Christmas tree from 1924 in the school garden and this is the tree that stands there today - over a hundred years later.\nAfter the school closed in 1936, the teachers\u0026rsquo; house was renamed \u0026ldquo;Four Winds\u0026rdquo;. The school buildings were demolished in 1964 and the private house in 1965.\nStone from the buildings was used in the road modifications at Devil\u0026rsquo;s Elbow near Princetown. From this, we know that the tree is in the old garden and the other enclosure used to be the play area.\nFoggintor Mission School Before Foggintor School was built, there was another school opposite the entrance to the track to Yellowmead. This was in the Foggintor Mission Hall, built in 1887. It served also as a school from Aug. 1896, opening with 41 pupils.\nIt had 95 pupils in 1903 and closed in Sep. 1912. The building was demolished in 1965. The numbers of young children give some idea of the population in the area, associated mainly with the busy quarries.\nReferences These sources were used when researching this walk:\nJack Walker, 2005, Dartmoor Sun, Halsgrove Discover Series, Halsgrove Publishing, Tiverton, Devon.

Then we walk along the Conchies Road and learn about this piece of World War One history before visiting an ancient burial cist.\nThere are a few short optional diversions to visit other cists along the way.\nPrincetown Prince\u0026rsquo;s Town was built by Thomas Tyrwhitt (1762-1833) and named in honour of the Prince of Wales, to whom he was Private Secretary. Thomas also built roads across Dartmoor and many other features. He was one of the Georgian Improvers who wanted to turn the \u0026ldquo;wastes\u0026rdquo; of Dartmoor into a thriving place to live and work.\nTyrwhitt was MP for Okehampton (1796-1802), Portarlington (1802-1806) and Plymouth (1806-1812). He built Dartmoor Prison in 1809 for French prisoners taken in the Napoleonic wars and it was also used for Americans taken in the 1812 war. He also built the Plymouth \u0026amp; Dartmoor Railway, which was originally a horse-dawn tramway that was later converted by the Great Western Railway to steam.\n2024: The Duchy Hotel has been rented from the Duchy of Cornwall by Dartmoor National Park Authority since 1991 for a fixed rent of £100 as an information centre. In November this year it was announced that despite informing almost 50,000 visitors this year, it is to close in May 2025 due to a shortfall in funding. Reference - ITV\nDrinking Fountain Dartmoor Prison Jonathan Stones tells me that he was told by \u0026lsquo;Sonny\u0026rsquo; Williams (an old farm hand) that he helped one Val Forder (sometime tenant of Sunnyside when a Duchy Farm) to transport the said gate from its original working position at Dousland. It\u0026rsquo;s second life here was as a \u0026lsquo;cattle crush\u0026rsquo;.\nAerial Ropeway The ropeway bringing timber from from Brimpts Plantation, powered by an engine at Moorlands Farm, ended nearby but I am told nothing visible remains. Many will remember old photographs in the Plume of Feathers in James Langton\u0026rsquo;s time showing the ropeway in action.\nThe ropeway was essentially an overhead cable supported by large wooden pylons that allowed relatively easy transport of wood from Brimpts, some four miles distant. Imagine something similar to a modern a ski lift, with logs suspended instead of skiiers.\nDevonport Leat Bachelors Hall Forest of Dartmoor 1840 Tithe Map showing a mine at bottom left in Plot 119 marked \u0026ldquo;Mine\u0026rdquo;, close to Bachelors Hall.\nThere is another structure in Plot 116, this being an un-named plot owned (also) by George Nicholson Esquire and leased to William Mitchell, as this appears to have a wheelpit and a stream as a water supply it can inferred that this is the smelting house (see following).\nThere are two lines drawn across the mine area. The left one (through \u0026ldquo;119\u0026rdquo;, coloured blue) was the original Bachelors Mine Leat that became the prison foul (an open sewer) and extended away from the mine. The thinner line (through the \u0026ldquo;9\u0026rdquo; of \u0026ldquo;119\u0026rdquo;) was its replacement, Blackabrook Leat.\nHeritage Gateway page on Bachelors Hall Tin Mine\nLooking at our map below, we\u0026rsquo;ve marked some points of interest here relating to the mine:\nA series of small tin pits, possibly contemporary with the early open-cast working of the area. Three shafts: Footway, Engine and Ann\u0026rsquo;s shafts, running NNE-SSW along the main tin lode. All 3 are now collapsed and capped. A whim, attached to Engine shaft about 11m in diameter within a bank 3.5m wide, 0.6m high with entrance in the WSW. Shallow adit, one of 3 adits known to have been associated with the mine. Two dressing floors with associated earthen platforms for buddles. Two wheel pits associated with stamps and dressing floors. The main wheelpit. A pump-rod gulley from the main waterwheel up to Engine shaft. The prison, or foul leat. Initially called the Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s Hall Leat and only extending as far as the mine was once the only source of water. After being taken over for use by the prison, mainly for sewage disposal, it was extended south and discontinued from mine use. It is now defunct. Blackbrook leat - its construction probably necessitated by the original leat being used for the prison. This is also defunct. Small reservoirs associated with the treatment areas of the mine. Areas of ridge and furrow cultivation, possibly contemporary with the mine. The Devonport, or Dock, Leat skirting the east side of the mine. Heritage Gateway page on bachelors Hall\nThe building is generally accepted as the site of the corn mill and bakery (permission dated 1798 but built post-1809), later converted to a Naphtha Works; the ruin downstream is thought to be a smelting works.\nBoth documentary and map sources indicate the existence of other buildings at Bachelors Hall. Thomas Tyrwhitt built a late 18th century house here and a few years later he was granted a lease to build a corn mill; this suggests two separate buildings.\nThe tithe map and census returns both imply the existence of a farm at Bachelors Hall which if proved would have co-existed with mill cottages for the short duration of the Naphtha Works.\nA second 19th century Duchy map shows Bachelors Hall as an L-shape building slightly larger than it is today.\nA building depicted downstream is allegedly the smelting works, and two structures higher up the hillside to the west annotated `Brewery\u0026rsquo;.\nThe 1839 Tithe Map depicts a building here of L-shape with other buildings and the farm outbuildings more or less as they are today.\nDetour below Bachelors Hall It\u0026rsquo;s a short and interesting diversion to continue down through the Hall on the marked footpath, then return back up. A few pictures of this follow.\nThe track is the left section of the photograph. The building appears on the tithe map image at the top edge.\nIt may be that this is the original house built by Tyrwhitt in the late 1700s and the modern buildings are where there were cottages for mill, bakery or mine workers.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re ready, end the Detour by returning to the track Smelting House Heritage Gateway Page for this Smelting House\nA tin smelting house was in operation at \u0026lsquo;Bachelors Hall\u0026rsquo; near Princetown from 1798-1807. It was erected by T Gray in 1795.\nSmelting is the process in which ingots of metal are won from the crushed ore by the process of heating until the metal is liquid - in this case Tin. The furnace is heated by whatever fuel is available - probably wood or charcoal here.\nIn the late 1790\u0026rsquo;s, John Swete described the smelting house as \u0026lsquo;on the banks of a small stream which emptied into Blackabrook\u0026rsquo; having stamping mills.\nDuchy of Cornwall records date from 1798-1804 that indicate 223 ingots were smelted in that period weighing 27.43 tonnes with a further 1.07 tonnes listed for 1807.\nIn sale particulars of 1828, the smelting house had been converted to a brewery.\nThe site of the brewery is shown on the sale plan as being beside the west bank of the stream where agricultural buildings now stand. The photograph above shows the presumed wheelpit for the stamping mill and combines blowing house.\nUsing these figures: 27.43 tonnes (metric) = 60,346 lbs (UK) = 270 lbs/ingot = 2.4 cwt. That is 121 kg or two small adults. Poor pack ponies.\nModern history of forestry on Dartmoor The building of nearby Tor Royal by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt at Prince\u0026rsquo;s Town was completed in 1798 and through the first decade of the 1800\u0026rsquo;s there were experimental plantings of coniferous shelterbelts to protect it.\nThe Duchy of Cornwall established a plantation at Brimpts in 1862. Forestry grew after WW1 in an effort to replace the country\u0026rsquo;s greatly depleted timber stock.\nBy 1930, plantations had been established at Fernworthy, Bellever, Brimpts, Bear Down, Soussons and Frenchbeer (Chagford) and in 1930 these areas were sold to the Forestry Commission (founded in 1919).\nBy 1938, the eastern slopes of Bellever Tor and Lakehead Hill were planted and the western slopes between 1940-1943. Source: The New Forests of Dartmoor (1964), London HMSO, Forestry Commission booklet No. 10, pages 6-10.\nThe tree of choice for planting on Dartmoor is the Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis, chosen for its high productivity compared to e.g. Douglas fir, Norway spruce, European larch and other fast-growing conifers. (text from the walk on 25 February 2018).\nBull Park Farm Bull Park farm was built by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt for a cattle-herdsman some time before 1833. Its enclosures were used to segregate bulls from cows and calves when not required for breeding.\nThe last tenant farmer quit on Christmas Day, 1957, and the property then became a holiday cottage.\nIt is now a private home and the owners told me that the old shed was the bull shed and still has rings in the wall for tying the bulls.\nThe Conchie Road This starts the \u0026ldquo;Conchie Road\u0026rdquo;.\nDuring the First World War, all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 41 were required to fight for their country. (Except for clergy, teachers and certain classes of industrial worker)\nParliament article about the Conscription Law\nOf those men, any who refused to fight for moral or other rules were labelled \u0026ldquo;Conscientious objectors\u0026rdquo;, or Conchies. They were not a well liked group of men, seen as cowards and abused and taunted by men and women alike.\nAs they would not fight or contribute to the war effort, they were treated as prisoners. Some were housed in Dartmoor Prison and as punishment for their \u0026ldquo;cowardice\u0026rdquo;, they were given hard labour.\nOne particularly pointless form of this work was to build this road. It goes nowhere and serves no purpose.\nThe work will have been hard and brutal. Stones taken both locally and from the Dartmoor Prison Quarry would have been hit repeatedly by sledgehammers until they were small enough to be packed into a solid base to form the road, again by packing with hammers or heavy tamps, and heavy man-powered rollers.\nAs you can see, there is little protection from the wind and driving wind up here. In winter especially, this would have been a truly miserable task.\nSuggested detour If you\u0026rsquo;re enjoying the walk, you may like to extend it by a mile or so by walking cross-moor North to Blakey Tor and back.\nThis is marked on the map as a dotted red line and takes in a pretty, rarely visited tor and another two ancient burial cists.\nDartmoor contains an unusally high occurence of cists, or burial cairns. These are stone tombs dating back to the Bronze age, some four thousand years ago. We know of several hundred of these, and more are still being found, having been buried by the peat\nEnd the suggested detour by returning to the Conchie Road as per the map Crock of Gold There\u0026rsquo;s no definite record of why this cist was so called. People have speculated that a crock (jar) of gold was found here, perhaps buried with the body that was once here.\nOr perhaps it was just wistful thinking, that grave robbers might find rich pickings? There are other Dartmoor similarly named - the Money Pit on Yar Tor is one such.\nParking Directions are provided for the main Princetown car park. This is pay and display, but off-peak you may find nearby on-road parking for free. Please do be considerate for the residents.\nNearby The Dartmoor Prison Museum is well worth a visit. The Fox Tor Cafe has excellent food The Old Police Station cafe also does good food, particularly fish and chips.

Also has EPB roughly carved on one side.\nThe old (left in this picture) and new boundary stones, marked A, B and EPB as above.\nThe Welstor Newtake wall behind was built in 1771 to enclose open moorland for grazing. We keep it on our left all the way to Buckland Beacon.\nHistorically, on Dartmoor, \u0026ldquo;newtakes\u0026rdquo; were enclosures of common land for agricultural purposes, and also to exclude others from grazing it. This practice often led to conflict between commoners who held rights over the land, and the landowners who erected these walls.\nDevil\u0026rsquo;s Hoofprint This interesting little copse looks like it may have been planted to shelter a house at some time, but no such remains are known. In any regard, it is a nice place to rest on a summer\u0026rsquo;s day.\nSheep creep The Ten Commandments Stones Reaching Buckland Beacon, we pass by on its left side and find the commandment stones laying open like the pages of a book.\nThe stones were commissioned by William Whitely of Wellstor, Lord of Buckland Manor, in 1928, in celebration of the rejection by Parliament of a proposed new Book of Common Prayer that was deemed \u0026ldquo;too popish\u0026rdquo; by many.\nThere are two dates on the stones: 15th Dec 1927 and 14 June 1928, that are the dates on which the revised book was rejected.\nWhen it was realised that there would be room to spare, the third verse of the hymn \u0026ldquo;Oh God our help in ages past\u0026rdquo; was added to the second stone.\nThere are 1,547 letters on the two stones and, due to weathering, the stones have needed to be recut several times, sometimes highlighted in black paint to aid legibility. This recutting is known to have happened in 1995, 2009, 2017 and most recently in 2020 as part of the \u0026ldquo;Moor than Meets the Eye\u0026rdquo; project.\nLefthand inscription I AM\nEx. 3 14\nTHE LORD THY GOD\nI\nTHOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER\nGODS BUT ME\nII\nTHOU SHALT NOT MAKE TO THYSELF\nANY GRAVEN IMAGES NOR THE\nLIKENESS OF ANYTHING THAT IS IN\nIN HEAVEN ABOVE OR IN THE EARTH\nBELOW OR IN THE WATER UNDER THE\nEARTH.

It continued in use until at least 1886 when depicted on the First Edition Ordnance Survey map, but by the time of the Second Edition (1905) it was absent, although William Crossing refers to it in his 1912 Guide to Dartmoor.\u0026rdquo;\nThere is a World War 2 Rifle range nearby on Halshanger Common. (It is the massive brick structure you may already have seen on this walk a mile or so to the East)\nHeritage Gateway page for this quarry Welstor Common rifle range page states: The target storehouse/shelter with its massive stone wall facing the firing lines. This rifle range was created in 1861 for the use of the Ashburton Rifle Volunteers. It was in use until about 1900, the 1905 OS map does not record it. There is very little evidence on the ground with the exception of this structure which was near the west end of the stop butt. There is a partially collapsed corrugated iron roof inside. the small quarry to the southwest appears to post date the rifle range.\nAshburton Golf Course From 1910 to the mid 1920s, this was the home of the Ashburton Golf Course - although no sign of it remains.\n\u0026ldquo;On Wednesday 16th February 1910 Mr J T Barker presided at a meeting in the Market Hall to discuss and consider the proposed golf club for Ashburton. The chairman stated that a committee had already been appointed to try and find a suitable location for the course and as a result a large portion of land on Welstor Common had been obtained. It had been generously offered by Mr Parnell Tucker at a nominal rent, he was also willing to erect a clubhouse which could also be rented. The area had been inspected by several experts and a professional all of them were strongly in favour of the location.\u0026rdquo;\nNote that the hanger is wedged in with iron feathers, showing it predates the more modern epoxy method of fixing which has been more generally used since the 1980s\nParking is usually to be had at Cold East Cross - marked with a yellow cross on the map.\n","date":"2024-12-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/buckland-beacon-ten-commandments-stone/16_hu_7016548909535b3e.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/buckland-beacon-ten-commandments-stone/","title":"Buckland Beacon, Ten Commandments Stone"},{"content":"Information Distance: 3 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Gentle A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words aside.explained.package Map We\u0026rsquo;ve used numbers in the photographs which correspond to the map to help with identification\nHigher Cherry Brook Bridge The Hairy Hands This road is famously recorded as having a pair of ghostly hands that take control of the steering wheel or handlebar or cars or motorbikes, forcing them off the road.\nMore information about The Hairy Hands Legend The Hairy Hands - Legendary Dartmoor Article The Hairy Hands - a British Film Institution film from 1965 by David Mudd Note from Simon: My mother once drove this road alone at night in the 1980s and swears she saw a coffin lying in her path. She swerved and avoided it, but didn\u0026rsquo;t dare return to investigate. I know of no other reports of coffins on this road but the incident was very close to the ancient Lich Way of which she wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware at the time. About the Lich Way Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Lich Way is a 17 mile path across Dartmoor from beyond Bellever through to Lydford. We join it on our way to the Powdermills for only a short distance, but it\u0026rsquo;s a very interesting piece of Ancient Dartmoor history. Prior to 1260, residents of the farms and villages in this area of Dartmoor belonged to the Parish of Lydford. This meant that as well as travelling off the moor to attend services, they were expected to bury their dead in the consecrated ground of Lydford, then a major and powerful town. Coffins were carried by ox or pony cart, strapped directly onto pack ponies, or carried by men. The route bears many memories of its purpose. There is a Coffin Wood, and many suitable large flat rocks along the route are identified as \u0026ldquo;Coffin Stones\u0026rdquo; where the heavy burden was laid so the carriers could rest. Lich or Lych? Both methods of spelling are in wide usage, both on Dartmoor and elsewhere. The word is thought to be derived from the German \u0026ldquo;leich\u0026rdquo; or Dutch \u0026ldquo;lijk\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;Corpse\u0026rdquo;, so perhaps Lich is the more correct. For more information about the Lich way, please see the excellent article on Legendary Dartmoor Arch Tor Arch Tor: The top stone is a large logan stone, with rock basins and an inscription that reads \u0026ldquo;PC\u0026rdquo; that has been suggested to refer to Powdermills Cottages. We\u0026rsquo;ll take a closer look on the walk back.\nAbout Gunpowder Gunpowder is a mixture of three components of varying proportions depending on intended use.\nMore info - Wikipedia\nHowever, the production of gunpowder is complicated and is unsurprisingly dangerous.\nThe Powdermills site is also complicated. Everything (except for the water) entered the site at the Southern entrance. Various stages in production occurred going up through the site to the three incorporation mills at the north end and then coming back down through the site until final storage in a main magazine ready for shipment to buyers.\nGunpowder, black powder or rock powder (local name) used for quarrying and mine blasting, is still used in fireworks.\nThe composition is 75% saltpetre, 15% charcoal and 10% sulphur (aka brimstone or burning stone).\nDynamite, more powerful, was patented in May 1867 by Alfred Nobel. Its success as a superior explosive led to eventual closure of the mills in 1897.\nThe ingredients, saltpetre (mostly from India), sulphur (mostly from the Vesuvius and Stromboli regions of Italy) and the charcoal (made from local wood, especially alder or alder buckthorn), were ground separately in a grinding mill house. These were then blended in the required proportions in large barrels tumbled by waterwheels. This incorporated them into a single compound using a combination of mixing, crushing and churning. This was a hazardous process that was governed by strict regulations and regular inspections. Only wooden and copper tools were allowed , so as to prevent sparks causing explosions. The men had to wear leather aprons and sof-soled shoes, no hobnail boots. There is a story that one man, Silas Sleep, who took his breakfast and dinner to eat at work, always ate them both together, in case he was \u0026lsquo;blowed up\u0026rsquo; and sent to meet his maker before lunch time.\n\u0026ldquo;Incorporation\u0026rdquo; was the first stage of production, in one of the three incorporation mills (\u0026ldquo;wheelhouses\u0026rdquo;) at the top of the site, it resulted in a form of \u0026ldquo;cake\u0026rdquo;. It was probably at this stage that the powders were dampened with water to reduce \u0026ldquo;dust\u0026rdquo; and prevent accidental explosions. This also helped the very soluble salpetre to mix into the porous charcoal. The resulting damp paste or \u0026ldquo;mill cake\u0026rdquo; was shaped into \u0026ldquo;corns\u0026rdquo;.\nThis was \u0026ldquo;ripe charge\u0026rdquo; that could be stored for a short period. It was then pressed down in e.g. a 2-ft square box to \u0026ldquo;press cake\u0026rdquo; about an inch thick. Originally this was a hand-powered process, like a cider press, but later a water wheel was used to drive the presses.\nThe next stage was \u0026ldquo;corning\u0026rdquo; when slabs of cake were broken up with wooden mallets into a granular form. Later, water-powered machines were used. This involved rollers and then sieving through different sized meshes. The powder was then tumbled in rotating barrels or cylinders. These were covered with gauze to collect any small dust-sized particles. This was another water-wheel powered process.\nThe next stage was \u0026ldquo;glazing\u0026rdquo;, where the grains were tumbled again, with graphite or black lead to give each grain of powder a waterproof coating. This made the powder suitabe for use in damp mines and quarrying.\nThe last stage was \u0026ldquo;drying\u0026rdquo;, sometimes in the open air. Usually, this was done in heated \u0026ldquo;Gloom stoves\u0026rdquo;. These were heated by an iron furnace with the powder laid on trays stacked around it. Later, steam stoves were used to heat pipes near the trays. The process used a flue to take away any sparks and fumes to a chimney - and this is seen at the south, bottom end of the site.\nThe final product was packed in large oak barrels that were covered with leather to prevent spillage and from stray sparks entering.\nThe gunpowder quality was tested periodically using the proving mortar that lies beside the road going into the Powdermills site. The strength was determined by firing a 68 lb iron ball over a distance that was then measured.\nBesides the actual gunpowder makers or millers, the Powdermills employed coopers, blacksmiths, carpenters, wagoneers, carters, wheelwrights, stable staff and labourers.\nThe Powdermills History George Frean, a Plymouth Alderman, founded the Plymouth \u0026amp; Dartmoor Gunpowder Company and opened Powdermills in 1844; it closed in 1897. It had employed about 100 men.\nGeorge Frean later teamed up with James Peek, one of three brothers importing tea - wanted a biscuit business for \u0026ldquo;tea and biscuits\u0026rdquo; - wrote to George Frean, \u0026ldquo;miller and ships biscuit maker\u0026rdquo;, who had married a niece of theirs, to manage Peak Freans\nThe whole complex was powered by water which was brought in by three leats. Initially, one leat came from the east bank of the Cherry Brook to a rectangular reservoir north of the three isolated incorporating mills. The water then returned to the Cherry Brook. The second leat came from the west side of the Cherry Brook to a circular reservoir behind the buildings. Water was taken for four years without Duchy permission. Permission was quickly granted because the Prince Consort, Prince Albert, had encouraged the venture. Later, water was also leated from the East Dart River to the north end reservoir. The water was then leated to water wheels used for grinding and powering other machinery.\nThe leat through the site is described in the book Industrial Archaeology of Dartmoor as now being dry and \u0026ldquo;two points at which it crosses the Cherry Brook, which flows between the buildings, can be seen. At one of these points, after feeding half the wheelhouses, the leat passes under the Cherry Brook through a wooden launder, which is still in place, in hard and excellent condition in spite of its years of saturation. Further downstream the leat\u0026rsquo;s channel back under the brook is of stone, big enough for a man to enter. The water had to be conveyed some way before being allowed to discharge, in order to prevent pollution of the Cherry Brook\u0026rdquo;.\nWaterwheels were used in the three massively-built incorporating mills (1,2,3 on the map), glazing mill (4), pressing house (5) and two in the incorporating/composition mill and cartridge pressing house/corning/dusting house and glazing mill complex (6,7), and the final preparation rooms (8), making eight altogether. There is also a ninth, disused wheelpit at the final preparation rooms with later lean-tos in it.\nSeparate from the powder works to the south, along the road in, is the row of 19th century buildings that included cottages, a manager\u0026rsquo;s house, school, cooperage and a small Methodist chapel. Today, there is a pottery, offices and farm buildings. South of the cottages beside the road is the proving mortar and nearby is a wheel-binding stone, used for fixing hot iron rims to cart and wagon wheels.\nLink to Heritage Gateway for one of the many Monuments on this site - see \u0026ldquo;Associated Monuments\u0026rdquo;\nThe Powdermills Site The site - starting below at South Chimney after entering at the top of the site.\nThere can be confusion identifying buildings when referring to the 2019 book and the 1990 survey listed above. The book starts at the south end of the site (page 98) with \u0026ldquo;Building 1\u0026rdquo; and the archaeogical survey starts from the north. The survey numbers are in (brackets).\nThere is no known map saying what each building was used for, so there is conjecture based on the gunpowder-making processes and the requirements for them to be carried out.\nAround the South Chimney If ready-made charcoal was brought in, then the South Chimney could have been for processing saltpetre, dissolving it and recrystallising it to make it more pure.\nThree phases of development and extension have been identified and it is likely that the function of the buildings changed over time. A flue and chimney indicate heat was involved. The flue to the chimney is about 1 metre deep and 1 metre wide. Its eastern portion is now open and rubble-filled, but the western portion is still capped. It enters the base of the chimney which is set on a plinth. The chimney is about 10.5 metres high.\nSouth Chimney with the 17 (18) Saltpetre / Charcoal Works behind. Across the track is the 2 (17) Cartridge Press House / Watch House / Store and up the slope behind that is the 1 (16) Watch House / Checking House. At the left edge are the roofs of the Powdermills Cottages, Pottery / Cafe, and offices.\nLeaving the chimney Immediately ahead is 3 (15) a Mixing House / Store behind the gate and tree, and to the right is 4 (14), a double structure that had two water wheels. The left section is believed to be a Cartridge Press House / Preparation Room and the right section is believed to be the Corning / Dusting House and Glazing Mill.\nPossibly a saltpetre crystallising house.\nLong rectangular single-storey building located at the southern end of the site and aligned north to south.. Two, possibly three, phases have been identified. Water was culverted through the building under the floor. Its north wall was probably the dwarf wall which now subdivides it from the extension to the north. Dwarf walls in one interior consist of one long spine wall and two side walls. Another dwarf wall runs east to west across the structure from the northernmost door to the east wall. These appear to form a raised floor with water, air or heat circulating beneath. A small, square, stone-lined feature to the west of the south-west corner may be a well, or possibly a pit in which staves were soaked. The building is described in the book as the Watch House, where materials in and out of the site were monitored. It might also have been used as a store.\nHidden behind is 3 (15) Mixing House / Store and to the right is 4 (14), a double structure that had two water wheels. The left section is believed to be a Cartridge Press House / Preparation Room and the right section is believed to be the Corning / Dusting House and Glazing Mill.\nSmall, rectangular, single-storey shed, in line with the track over the brook to the South Chimney. Aligned north to south. South gable end mostly survives. The west wall stands to full height; the east wall survives only as footings. No doors or windows are present in the three standing walls. There is plaster rendering on the interior. Small stone-lined channel runs east to west down the outside of, and parallel to, the south wall.\nIncorporating/composition mill (south), possible cartridge press house (south of N building) and possible corning/dusting house/glazing mill. Consists of two pairs of structures on either side of two wheelpits. The tailrace of the southern wheepit discharges back to the Cherrybrook. The wheel between the southern mill was powered by a continuation of the leat powering buildings to the north. The wheelpit tailrace discharged via a channel into Cherry Brook. The culvert has an arched roof of granite blocks overlain by slabs.\nLong, rectangular gable-ended(?) building aligned north-south with an east-west wheelpit to the south. The wall of the wheelpit is visible only in the west. The position of the sluice is identifiable. The tailrace is not visible. This where a waterwheel powered a press to squeeze moisture out of the gunpowder.\nSmall building, aligned north to south just south of the glazing mill (below). There is a large rectangular stone table, 20-25 centimetres thick, on a masonry base.The table top is smooth. On this, the slabs of pressed gunpowder were broken down.\nLong rectangular building, aligned north / south. The structure contains supports for a raised floor, or to support machinery such as glazing barrels. The internal supports may alternatively have been to provide under-floor ventilation. There is a wheelpit at the south end of the building. This where \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; pieces of gunpowder from the Breaking House were sieved and large pieces were returned to the Breaking House and fine powder was returned to the Press House.\nThere is a Circular Reservoir on the hill above between this building and the preceding building.\nPossibly where \u0026ldquo;corns\u0026rdquo; i.e. sieved gunpowder was stored. This facing the track coming down the hill from the three incorporation mills - note the fingerboard signpost.\nIt is probable that these buildings were used for dusting, glazing, sieving and packing the gunpowder prior to carting it it off-site. Horses may have been stabled here as well as barrels and other materials being stored here. There are two mills powered by a waterwheel.\n\u0026lsquo;Gloom\u0026rsquo; or steam stone used for drying gunpowder. A portion of the west wall of \u0026ldquo;Unit D\u0026rdquo; (in the survey) remains, in the centre of which is a flue leading to the chimney 5-6 metres to the south-west. Two wheel cogs lie at the east end of the building, but may not be in situ.\nSimilar in plan to \u0026lsquo;Buildings 1 and 2\u0026rsquo;, consisting of two units flanking a central wheelpit. The wheelpit is largely filled with rubble. The wheel was powered by water from the tailrace of the wheelpit of \u0026lsquo;Building 2\u0026rsquo;. The three incorporating mill houses (\u0026ldquo;wheelhouses\u0026rdquo;) were of massive construction with many granite blocks being 6-feet long and the was about 6-feet thick, to withstand inadvertent explosions. The roofs were very flimsy, of wood and tar, to blow off without damaging the main structure. They could be replaced easily.\nTar drips indicate that either it was not gable ended, or the gable ends were constructed of timber of lesser width than the walls below. Water outflow continues west in the form of a leat, towards \u0026lsquo;Building 3\u0026rsquo;.\nBackground: 5 (1) Incorporating Mill: Consists of a pair of gable-ended structures flanking a large central wheelpit. Both of massive granite blocks with walls about 2 metres thick at their bases.\nTar dribbles indicate original roofing was of tarred tarpaulin or wood. This was probably to allow any accidental explosion to go upwards and leave the walls standing, a technique still used by artisinal powder makers in India and China today.\nThe wheelpit is aligned north-east to south-west and runs the whole width of the units. Wheel axle appears to have projected into their ground floors. Powered by a launder to the north-east which flowed out through a culvert to the south-west. This is roofed for 3.5 - 4 metres, then becomes an open channel which runs downhill to feed the reservoir belonging to \u0026lsquo;Building 2\u0026rsquo;.\nThe raised bank at the left brought the leat that fed a launder to the waterwheel.\nArch Tor An \u0026ldquo;extra\u0026rdquo; to the walk: exit the site via the gate at the top right corner, past the Incorporation Mills, and walk out straight to Arch Tor. The whole top stone \u0026ldquo;logs\u0026rdquo; i.e. rocks, as a logan stone.\nExtra bits This proving mortar is just off the road, on the left, on the last bend when driving in approaching the Pottery, cafe and mill cottages.\nIt fired a (probably) 68 lb ball to test the powder. The distance travelled by the ball was a measure of the strength of the powder and undoubtedly a good sales tactic for potential buyers.\nThis walk was reached from a small roadside layby marked by the yellow cross below the \u0026ldquo;Lich Way Plaque\u0026rdquo; label on the map. Normally, for a group, it would be reached from the main car park in Postbridge or the car park in the forest just across the road from it. There is also a car park at Higher Cherry Brook Bridge, marked with the P symbol and yellow cross on the map\nPlease note that there is no parking available at the Powdermills Pottery and shop except when visiting them\n","date":"2024-11-26T00:00:00Z","image":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/the-powder-mills/19_hu_ac6ff7e7e98b07f9.jpg","permalink":"https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/the-powder-mills/","title":"The Powder Mills"},{"content":"Information Distance: 3 miles, walked by Keith Ryan and transcribed by Simon Avery Grade: Medium A GPX route of this walk is available: Download GPX Directions to Car Park What Three Words ferrets.sonic.inner Map Introduction Venford Reservoir has all-year parking.

These include old tinner\u0026rsquo;s stones, several artificial caves, a longhouse, a ruined tin mill, the Devonport leat, wheel pits and an abandoned tare and feathers still wedged in the rock.\nNorsworthy Bridge Ruined blowing house Devonport Leat Cross Gate Cairn \u0026amp; Cist Wikipedia Article about Dartmoor Treacle Mining\nThis adit is found down the slope below Leathertor Farm. Look down the slope for the biggest tree stump near the river and the next stump downriver i.e. to rhe right. The mine entrance is hidden in the slope, between the two stumps.\nThe Fougou (Cave) Note the granite slabs forming the roof, making this a man-made cave (for tools) rather than the more usual potato cave. Potato caves are normally dug into growan (\u0026ldquo;rotted\u0026rdquo; granite). In this photograph, there is water in the fougou. The dimensions are 11-feet deep, 3-feet wide, 4-feet high, with the entrance being just 2-feet high (Hemery, High Dartmoor, p.124). There is a traditional potato cave just 50 metres away on the track below Leathertor Farm.\nHeritage Gateway Article for this fougou\nLeathertor Farm Leathertor Farm is first recorded in Bailiff\u0026rsquo;s Accounts for the Manor of Dartmoor in 1362, regarding the renting of land at Leddertorre. Later, in 1511, more detailed reports were made. The last tenant was William Lillicrap who abandoned the farm in 1924. Some occupants were also tinners.\nSource: Paul Rendell (2007) Exploring Around Burrator, The Dartmoor Company, Okehampton, pages 20 and 55.

Mashford for £26.10s. This is a little more elaborate than most clapper bridges in that it has parapets.\nSource: Eric Hemery, High Dartmoor, page 126. Apparently, this was the last clapper bridge to be built on Dartmoor (Johnies Meanderings, 20th August 2012). Riddipit Farm Hemery (p.127) notes alternative names are Ritthy Pit, Riddy Pit, Reedapit (1611), possibly to do with rushes, rishes or reeds. There were two houses here, shown on the 1840 tithe map - the remains of one longhouse are seen at the right edge of this photograph and the second one is seen across the clearing, down by the track. There are other ruined buildings, possibly barns, animal sheds or labourers\u0026rsquo; dwellings.\nRiddipit Stream rises above the site and crosses the track in a granite conduit.\nCrossing\u0026rsquo;s Guide, p.100: Riddy Pit, there are stones with hollows in them (i.e. mortar stones), now in the paving of the track, a little beyond this view up the track. Close by, is an old wall, in the nearby hedge is a stone with a cavity on each side. Another curious stone with a round top and a piece of iron leaded into it is probably the upper stone of a crushing mill: this was never found by Hemery.\nFirst recorded 1564, abandoned by 1871 when the enclosures were incorporated into Leather Tor Farm.\nSource: Paul Rendell (2007) Exploring Around Burrator, The Dartmoor Company, pages 31 and 57 Heritage Gateway Article for Riddipit Farm\nHeritage Gateway Article for this Southern Farmbuilding\nHeritage Gateway Article for this Northern Farmbuilding\nDescribed as a blowing house, but with no trace of a leat, launder bank or wheel pit, three necessary signs for a blowing house or tin mill, therefore probably a cart shed for the farm (Hemery p.128).\nHowever, the field behind this hedge is called \u0026ldquo;Mill Park\u0026rdquo; in the tithe apportionments (Plot 930).\nAlso, the remains an old mortar stone is to be found here under the leaves and debris - but mortar stones are found widespread in the area.\nHeritage Gateway Article for this Stamping Mill\nMortar Stone Big Potato Cave RN Worth (1967) Worth\u0026rsquo;s Dartmoor, David \u0026amp; Charles, page 417, describes it as a potato cave (always dug into growan) but Eric Hemery (1983) High Dartmoor, Robert Hale, London, page 129, argues that it shows signs of corbelling (as used in beehive huts, never seen in potato caves) and is in fact a cache (or vooga / fougou) for miners\u0026rsquo; tools from the Keaglesborough (Kekelles Burrowghe) Tin Mine.\nHeritage Gateway Article for this potato cave\nKeaglesborough Mine The earliest reference to tinworking on this site is in a deed from 1538, where it is called Kekylsburgh. There is also a mention in a Walkhampton Manor court roll dated 1565 of Kekellas Burrowghe Mill. There are other references in deeds etc.\nKeaglesburrowe Sett, \u0026ldquo;Keagles Burro also Lambards Park\u0026rdquo; (1748-65) and again (1811-20), another mention in 1820 uses \u0026ldquo;Lambers Parks Alies Kegales Borough\u0026rdquo; (= alias) and later Keagles Burrow Mine. Source: Mike Brown (2001) Guide to Dartmoor, CD-ROM, Dartmoor Press, Grid Square 573 701.\nTin mining started with men following alluvial deposits up streams and rivers and then digging into veins/lodes with pits and openworks (gerts or beams) into the hills. An Openwork in the nearby Newleycombe valley (Kingsett Gert) was first mentioned in 1505 (then, a long time in dispute), with a later date of 1639 (i.e. more than 140 years working). Ref. Phil Newman (1998), The Dartmoor Tin Industry - A Field Guide, Chercombe Press, Newton Abbot, p.8.\nEarly tin workings, while being a large industry in medieval times, finally ceased production by 1750 (Newman, Ibid, p.55).\nIn the late 1700s and 1800s, workings started going underground - with drainage effected by adits, horizontal tunnels driven into hillsides to let water run out of the workings e.g. Keaglesborough and Eylesborough.\nThere are two \u0026ldquo;dressing floors\u0026rdquo; on this site, these being areas where mined rock is treated to concentrate the tin by crushing (under iron \u0026ldquo;stamps\u0026rdquo; falling againt mortar stones) to separate the tin-bearing rock from other rock of no value. The end of the leat that powered the waterwheel is probably the raised grassy area seen towards the top right in the photograph \u0026hellip;..\nThis wheel was operating in 1801; length of wheelpit - 6.2 metres (20 feet) with a double-sided dressing floor, rectangular buddles. Source: Newman, Landscape, p.53 (see below for full reference).\nHeritage Gateway MDV35575 - Keaglesborough Mine\nTinning was important on Dartmoor from about 1150 and throughout the Middle Ages.\nStannary records show that in the busiest period, 1515-1538, the \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo; output of white tin metal presented annually for coinage was about 500,000 lbs i.e. 223 tons. Thus, over this 24 years, this would have been 5,357 tons. If a mould stone produced ingots that weighed about 1 cwt then this means 107,143 ingots were produced. It is believed that not all tin was presented for coinage and taxation.\nSource: Interpretation of data in: Tom Greeves (2017),The World of the Dartmoor Tinner: An Historical Context 12th to 20th Century.

But then, all land on Dartmoor is owned by someone, whether it is Common Land or not. Hound Tor is clearly an \u0026ldquo;avenue tor\u0026rdquo;, where the central portion has been eroded to leave a central avenue running between the remaining piles - other examples are Bellever Tor, Haytor, Rippon Tor and Pew Tor. In fact, there are several avenues through Hound Tor.\nThe road through Swallerton Gate leads to Swine Down and, further on, to Kitty Jay\u0026rsquo;s grave. An old gate post can be seen on the left (see next photograph). Beyond, there is a cottage on the left, Swallerton Gate, formerly the Hound Tor Inn until 1840 and thought before that to have been the Green Dragon Inn. It was recorded as Swine Down Cottage in the 1851 Census (Source: Mike Brown, 7389 7915 and 737 796).\nIt is well-situated on the road between Ashburton and Chagford - two busy market towns. It would also have been used by the inhabitants of Widecombe and Ilsington on their way to market. There is an old cross in the garden wall of the cottage. Source: Dave Brewer (2002), Dartmoor Boundary Markers, Halsgrove, p. 115.\nThere are records that Thor Heyerdahl wrote at least part of The Kon-Tiki Expedition in the cottage.\nThis cross was going to be used in the hardcore for the floor of the extension but an intervention pointed out that is was a medieval cross head. The intervention came from a passing Harry Starkey, a well-known Dartmoor guide to whom there is a memorial locally on the back of the replaced Duke Stone on the Ilsington Manor boundary at SX 74605 77305, close to Becka Brook.\nThis could be the cross formerly known as Swine Path Cross, at what is now known as Swallerton Gate, that is mentioned in a description of the boundary between Chagford and Ashburton Stannaries that dates from the last meeting of a Stannary Court in 1786 at Crockern Tor, using a \u0026ldquo;Presentiments of the Bounds of the several Stannary Courts of Devon\u0026rdquo; dated 1613 (Brewer, pp.269-273).\nAddendum: FH (Harry) Starkey (1987) Dartmoor\u0026rsquo;s Crosses and Some Ancient Tracks, Revised Edition, pages 155-156, records that the cross was found in a nearby hedge in 1939 and was described by EN Masson Phillips in Transactions of the Devonshire Association, Vol. LX11 (1940) page 267.\nKitty Jay It is said that the local parishes of Manaton, Widecombe-in-the-Moor and North Bovey all refused to bury poor Kitty\u0026rsquo;s body in consecrated ground because she had commited suicide. In those times this was considered to be self-murder and therefore a mortal sin.\nIt is also said that burial at crossroads was chosen possibly as a warning to others and also to confuse the spirit or ghost of the departed so that they might not easily find their way back to where they had lived and be of nuisance to the living.\nThe Burial of Suicide Act 1823 did away with the requirement for crossroads burials.\nAddendum: Devon \u0026amp; Dartmoor Historic Environment Record - MDV7489 Jay\u0026rsquo;s Grave - one report in this record (by Beeson M, 2018) mentions Ann Jay, Kay, Betty Kay, an 1882 poem referring to Kay\u0026rsquo;s Grave, and Betsy Kay. An eyewitness to the exhumation put her death to around 1780-1790.\nWho was Kitty Jay?\nHer name has been recorded as Ann Jay (1851), Kay (an old woman, 1876), Betty Kay (1881), Kitty Jay (Crossing, Guide to Dartmoor, p.295, 1912), \u0026ldquo;J\u0026rdquo; (1914), Mary Jay (1934). She has also been recorded as \u0026ldquo;Jane\u0026rdquo; as in Jane\u0026rsquo;s Grave.\nThe report by William Crossing says that on 25th January 1851, Mr. James Bryant of Hedge Barton had the grave opened after it was found by workers tidying the area. Bones were found that were confirmed by a visiting doctor to be those of a young woman. They were reburied in a wooden box and the stones were placed to form the grave as it is seen today.\nReprinting a Widecombe History Group item that was told by Beatrice Chase in the Western Morning News on 3rd March 1934:\nA Workhouse apprentice hired out by the parish to Barracott Farm, Manaton. Hanged herself in a barn at Ford Farm. A parish register that recorded Apprentices 1804-1840 contained the name of Mary Jay among them, as well as the names of witnesses, overseer and assenting magistrate.\nThe father of Mr Robert Nosworthy, born at Ford \u0026ldquo;exactly one hundred years ago\u0026rdquo; (written in 1934, therefore born 1834), always spoke of her as Mary Jay, as did his great aunt, a generation back. Original OS maps had it labelled as Jay\u0026rsquo;s Grave but Mr John Kitson of Heatree had it changed to Jane\u0026rsquo;s Grave. His family agreed it should be reverted to Jay\u0026rsquo;s Grave (1937-1961 1:25k Series). OS 25-inch 1885/1886. The adjacent single sheet map has Swallerton Gate marked as Swinedown Gate.\nCrippon Rock Feldspar crystals indicate that the rock cooled slowly after it was formed. this example is probably plagioclase feldspar (ie of a family containing NaAlSi3O8 to CaAl2Si2O8 and usually white. The alternative would be an orthoclase feldspar (ie containing potassium KAlSi3O8 ) but those are usually pinkish in hur. In granite, quartz crystals are usually greyish and translucent. My thanks to John Viant for this information\nLogan Stone Medieval Longhouse ruins The uphill left corner of the house is marked by the hawthorn tree with the rest of the house being in the right half of the photograph - it was difficult to photograph against the sun. The orientation is as it is in the diagram below: this is described by Jeremy Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities, Vol. 1 - The East, Map 21 - 5: Blissmoor longhouse (fig. 21.3), page 155\nBowerman\u0026rsquo;s Nose The story of Bowerman is that many years ago he lived in the Manaton area and was a keen hunter.\nOne day his hounds started a hare and he gave chase. He was so keen to catch the hare that he did not notice that the hounds had led him through a coven of witches, knocking over their cauldron. They were so incensed that they decided he must be punished.\nThe next time he was out hunting, one of the witches transformed herself into a white hare - a highly prized trophy. She led him the merriest chase of his life until he was near exhaustion. Then she led him and his hounds back to this spot where the other witches were waiting.\nThey turned him into a pillar of granite as punishment, right here, where he must gaze out for all eternity on his favourite hunting lands.\nHis hounds ran in fear for their lives but the witches turned on them as well, turning them to stone on a nearby hill - which is known today as \u0026ldquo;Hound Tor\u0026rdquo;.\nHayne Down Rocks Moyle\u0026rsquo;s Gate Swallerton Rocks This walk was reached by following the \u0026ldquo;Widecombe\u0026rdquo; sign from the A38 just past Ashburton, heading towards Exeter, via Owlacombe Cross, Halshanger Cross, turn right at Cold East Cross, left at Hemsworthy Gate after passing Rippon Tor on the right.

Grazing, stone, peat - but not green oak or venison.\nThe farm was abandoned somewhere in the middle of the 1900s - the kitchen range and abandoned vehicles date from the 30\u0026rsquo;s onwards.\nTwist was put up for sale in 1934 and likely fell into dereliction relatively soon afterwards, perhaps during the second world war which drained many young men from the country.\nMore information from Dartmoor Explorations Heritage Gateway Article Note that some pictures come from Simon\u0026rsquo;s visits in 2017 and 2019\nIncomplete venville building This unassuming pile of stones is perhaps the remains of a \u0026ldquo;cottage in a day\u0026rdquo; undertaking - wherein you could live on the land if you could \u0026ldquo;build and roof a house between the house of sunrise and sunset, and have smoke coming out of its chimney\u0026rdquo;.\nIn this case, it\u0026rsquo;s said that the building was interrupted by local residents who didn\u0026rsquo;t want it there and failed the challenge.\nClapper Bridge Devon United Mine and Shaft The North mine was worked for copper until the 1850\u0026rsquo;s.
