>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quarryman once stood at this point making Setts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Setts are granite blocks that were much used for paving roads and paths, and can still be seen in many cities, for they last a very long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rough cut setts blocks be brought here, having been cut from moorstone nearby. To cut down on transport, the bankers typically set up very close by to the raw material, and their workplaces - bankers - were rough and ready; somewhere to stand or kneel and work the stone at around waist level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In exposed conditions, and this certainly qualifies, they would erect shelters to keep off the worst of the rain, snow and wind. These would have been made of oilskin tarpaulin with a stick framework, probably on three sides, backed to the wind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tools were iron chisels and a hammer, with the working stone set on a bed on firm earth and granite chips, which would absorb the blows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a hard job. As well as the obvious difficulties of weather and repetitive, physical work; the sett-maker’s hearing will have suffered and worse, many will have suffered from silicosis from breathing granite dust and died early from lung problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional stonemasons still work very similarly to this, but now have tungsten tipped chisels and, when working with granite, a full-face respirator system.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When I worked for DNPA in the late 1980s, they often employed a traditional stonemason who would work just inside the entrance of the Works Depot in Bovey Tracey. He had a 45 gallon oil drum full of granite chips on which he’d place his work, which might be a perfectly spherical ball to sit atop a gatepost. He’d stand there all day, chipping away. Pausing every now and then to offer up a hardboard template to check his progress, or check diameter with a set of large calipers. He wore a full face respirator, with a battery pack and inlet on his belt at the back, similar to those used by industrial welders, which blew filtered air into the mask. – Simon&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There are Bankers all around this area.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This noticeably man made structure is known as Duke&amp;rsquo;s Folly, after William Duke who opened Merrivale Quarry in 1875. His grand plan was to build a railway across Long Ask to link with the Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway at Swell Tor Quarry, to provide an easy route out for his stone to Plymouth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His Folly here is a granite embankment made up of mostly waste rock from the main quarry, but is about as far as he got before the plan was abandoned.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As mentioned, Merrivale Quarry was opened by William Duke 1875 and originally called &amp;ldquo;Tor Quarry&amp;rdquo; and it absorbed the existing sett-making operations carried out under the Staple Tors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As well as cutting setts, Granite from the quarry was also used for Gravestones, agricultural rollers and the like. It also provided the facing for the New Scotland Yard building in London.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The quarry closed in 1997, spending its final years dressing imported stone from Norway.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This walk is mostly on open moorland avoiding steep hills. There is a huge amount of unique history here that cannot fail to make one pause and wonder. Stone rows, stone circles, carved granite and a school for the children of the quarryworkers at nearby Foggintor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The round object in the left foreground is often described as an abandoned runner, that is, the running wheel, that would be turned on an axle pulled by a horse with the stone running in a circular trough crushing apples for making cider: i.e. an abandoned apple crusher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, that is not accurate&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In 1905, the Western Morning News and other papers published a story about this stone, claiming it was a buried quoit or dolmen with a worked capstone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can be fairly sure that this report was inaccurate thanks to &lt;cite>William Crossing, who wrote in Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Early History &amp;amp; Medieval remains, Chap 12&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>eventually a man was found before any scientific paper was written who pronounced: &amp;ldquo;Twadn&amp;rsquo;t no old man cut thacky stone,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;I cut&amp;rsquo;n.&amp;rdquo; This is an abandoned top-stone to a crazing mill, an old way of grinding tin ore before it was smelted.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>In the distance we can see Merrivale Quarry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William Duke opened this as &amp;ldquo;Tor Quarry&amp;rdquo; in 1876, its operations absorbing the old sett-making craft previously carried out under the Staple Tors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As well as cutting setts, Granite from this quarry was also used for Gravestones, agricultural rollers and the like. It also provided the facing for the New Scotland Yard building in London.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The quarry closed in 1997, spending its final years dressing imported stone from Norway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name &amp;ldquo;Merrivale&amp;rdquo; for this part of Walkhampton Common is said to derive from &amp;ldquo;mara val&amp;rdquo; in old Cornish, meaning &amp;ldquo;plague market&amp;rdquo;. This is thought to have been corrupted from &amp;ldquo;tin market&amp;rdquo;, although &amp;ldquo;potato market&amp;rdquo; has also been suggested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In times of the Black Death (1348-1353: when 50 million people died in Europe (Not to be confused with the Great Plague of London, 1665-1666), farmers left food here for Tavistock people who left coins as payment soaking in vinegar to clean them of the badness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Mar val&amp;rdquo; has also been interpreted as Mirey Vale.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Early, possibly medieval or even earlier, tin workings where tinners collected alluvial deposits along stream beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The eroded tin ore could form quite pure tin gravel in such areas, having been washed down from the surrounding granite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The early tinners &amp;ldquo;leated&amp;rdquo; water to a trench at the lower end of the ground, called a &amp;rsquo;tye&amp;rsquo; and water was used to wash away the lighter &amp;lsquo;gangue&amp;rsquo; gravels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method left banks of waste behind. The area is surrounded by a scarp that shows the original level of the land and the depth of the deposits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tin streaming was often followed by open cast mining to go deeper, into big cuttings called &amp;ldquo;gerts&amp;rdquo;, but this is not seen here.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was presumably this water source that was diverted and used for washing away the lighter sediments so as to leave the heavier tin-bearing gravels and sands for smelting. This would have been among the earliest tin-extraction methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This photograph also shows the scarp surrounding this area that suggests how much the early tinners changed the look of the landscape.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the photograph above, a portion of the pillar has been enhanced to show the &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; more clearly, facing towards Ashburton.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Middle Ages,this trading route was very important, especially for wool and cloth or yarn, going via Sheepstor - which was famed for its sheep and wool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The track was superseded by the turnpike road in 1792.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strangers to the moor often had to tackle this high lonely route, this section over the Princetown area was the highest part and the most exposed. Princetown, or Thomas Tyrwhitt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Prince&amp;rsquo;s Town&amp;rdquo;, did not exist in those days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Guide posts were erected along the way and what we see today are possibly the more &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; (1669) improved series, which were sponsored by Plymouth Corporation at the princely sum of £2.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Four Winds was the site of Foggintor School, built 1914, opened April 1915 with 55 children from the nearby cottages associated with Foggintor and other quarries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr &amp;amp; Mrs Stoyle were the teachers, it was a spacious building with a wood block floor and central heating - the pipes were used for warming their pasties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were periods of closure due to snow and whooping cough. The garden had bees, poultry, a goat and rabbits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the school building there was also School House, for the teachers. One section of the enclosure was the playing field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The school was run throughout its history by Fred Stoyle, the youngest head-teacher in the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their son, Ivan, planted the Christmas tree from 1924 in the school garden and this is the tree that stands there today - over a hundred years later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the school closed in 1936, the teachers&amp;rsquo; house was renamed &amp;ldquo;Four Winds&amp;rdquo;. The school buildings were demolished in 1964 and the private house in 1965.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stone from the buildings was used in the road modifications at Devil&amp;rsquo;s Elbow near Princetown. From this, we know that the tree is in the old garden and the other enclosure used to be the play area.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="foggintor-mission-school">Foggintor Mission School
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Before Foggintor School was built, there was another school opposite the entrance to the track to Yellowmead. This was in the Foggintor Mission Hall, built in 1887. It served also as a school from Aug. 1896, opening with 41 pupils.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It had 95 pupils in 1903 and closed in Sep. 1912. The building was demolished in 1965. The numbers of young children give some idea of the population in the area, associated mainly with the busy quarries.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Ten Commandments stone is a piece of natural granite that has been cut and shaped and engraved to show the ten commandments, plus an eleventh!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This walk starts with a gentle uphill route along some nice granite walling with some good views to the North to the Tor where the stone is to be found. The return route takes in some relatively unknown Welstor Common Rifle Range, dating back to 1861 and pre-dates the much larger training range to the East.&lt;/p>

>cross at Buckland Manor&lt;/a> and several other nearby stones. These were erected to mark the boundary of Buckland Manor in 1837, a year before his death.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Welstor Newtake wall behind was built in 1771 to enclose open moorland for grazing. We keep it on our left all the way to Buckland Beacon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Historically, on Dartmoor, &amp;ldquo;newtakes&amp;rdquo; were enclosures of common land for agricultural purposes, and also to exclude others from grazing it. This practice often led to conflict between commoners who held rights over the land, and the landowners who erected these walls.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reaching Buckland Beacon, we pass by on its left side and find the commandment stones laying open like the pages of a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stones were commissioned by William Whitely of Wellstor, Lord of Buckland Manor, in 1928, in celebration of the rejection by Parliament of a proposed new Book of Common Prayer that was deemed &amp;ldquo;too popish&amp;rdquo; by many.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two dates on the stones: 15th Dec 1927 and 14 June 1928, that are the dates on which the revised book was rejected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When it was realised that there would be room to spare, the third verse of the hymn &amp;ldquo;Oh God our help in ages past&amp;rdquo; was added to the second stone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are 1,547 letters on the two stones and, due to weathering, the stones have needed to be recut several times, sometimes highlighted in black paint to aid legibility. This recutting is known to have happened in 1995, 2009, 2017 and most recently in 2020 as part of the &amp;ldquo;Moor than Meets the Eye&amp;rdquo; project.&lt;/p>

>this 1886 OS map&lt;/a> which clearly defines the 200, 300, 600 and 800 yard firing positions that would have fired upon this target. Note: These firing positions are not at all obvious and they were originally probably little more than low earth banks for the men to lie down to aim from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One supposes that wooden or canvas targets were raised above it, with the stone structure providing shelter for the range operators.&lt;/p>

>Devon &amp;amp; Dartmoor Heritage &amp;ldquo;Rifle Range on Welstor Common&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> includes: &amp;ldquo;A rifle range was established on Welstor Common in 1861 for use by the Ashburton Rifle Volunteers and represents the earliest recorded military training within the Rippon Tor PAL (Premier Archaeological Landscape). It continued in use until at least 1886 when depicted on the First Edition Ordnance Survey map, but by the time of the Second Edition (1905) it was absent, although William Crossing refers to it in his 1912 Guide to Dartmoor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a World War 2 Rifle range nearby on Halshanger Common. (It is the massive brick structure you may already have seen on this walk a mile or so to the East)&lt;/p>

>Welstor Common rifle range page&lt;/a> states: The target storehouse/shelter with its massive stone wall facing the firing lines. This rifle range was created in 1861 for the use of the Ashburton Rifle Volunteers. It was in use until about 1900, the 1905 OS map does not record it. There is very little evidence on the ground with the exception of this structure which was near the west end of the stop butt. There is a partially collapsed corrugated iron roof inside. the small quarry to the southwest appears to post date the rifle range.&lt;/p>

>Ashburton Golf Course&lt;/a> - although no sign of it remains.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;On Wednesday 16th February 1910 Mr J T Barker presided at a meeting in the Market Hall to discuss and consider the proposed golf club for Ashburton.
The chairman stated that a committee had already been appointed to try and find a suitable location for the course and as a result a large portion of land on Welstor Common had been obtained.
It had been generously offered by Mr Parnell Tucker at a nominal rent, he was also willing to erect a clubhouse which could also be rented.
The area had been inspected by several experts and a professional all of them were strongly in favour of the location.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
