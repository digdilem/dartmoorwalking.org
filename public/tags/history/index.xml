&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most picturesque and popular Dartmoor destinations. The abandoned quarries have been retaken by nature despite having been worked as recently as 1966. The quarries once supported an entire village of based here at Foggintor, with a School, Chapel and 30 cottages. The landscape will have looked very differently here two hundred years ago at the height of its industry. Now only evocative ruins remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the road from the parking area are the ruins of the old non-denominational Mission Hall, built in 1887 and demolished in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to problems at Foggintor school, the Mission Hall opened as a school on 17th August 1896 to house 41 pupils and soon that grew to 95 children. The school closed on 27th September 1912 and the children went to temporary schools at Merrivale and back to Foggintor Chapel until the new school opened at what is now known as Four Winds, on 19th April 1915.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the photograph above, Great Mis Tor is seen at top right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We start our walk by following the track away from the road to the South&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leat still supplies Yellowmeade and formerly ran on to supply Foggintor. It is probable that the cottages were supplied by a bullseye stone to regulate water use.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cottages stood  on the high ground on the left of the photograph (but to the right of the track) and were separated from their gardens by a back lane. The cottages were planned in 1846 and built by April 1849. They were probably demolished in 1953, the same year as Hill Cottages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to various Censuses, they were originally known as Mount Pleasant Cottages, then West View Cottages, and after that, Red Cottages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were built with cob and by 1871 the weather got into them so badly they were &amp;ldquo;covered with corrugated iron&amp;rdquo; and painted with red lead, thus becoming known as Red Cottages - this appears in the 1871 Census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kath Brewer writes in &amp;ldquo;The Railways, Quarries and Cottages of Foggintor&amp;rdquo; that in later years they were actually black, having been covered with pitch, again against the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were six cottages but with twelve dwellings - with &amp;ldquo;one up, one down&amp;rdquo;. In the 1861 Census, there were thirteen families with 50 adults and 38 children at West View, as the cottages were known at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large weighted iron bars were used to drill the granite to take the explosive charge. These drills, known as Jumpers, were tested here to ensure they were sharp enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;lumps and bumps&amp;rdquo; in the background are waste tips of Foggintor Quarry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellowmeade Farm itself was not established until 1860, the last farm to be founded in Walkhampton Parish. It was enclosed by George Cole whose family lived there until about 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarryman once stood at this point making Setts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setts are granite blocks that were much used for paving roads and paths, and can still be seen in many cities, for they last a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rough cut setts blocks be brought here, such as cut from the Cake Stone above. To cut down on transport, the bankers typically set up very close by to the raw material, and their workplaces - bankers - were rough and ready; somewhere to stand and work the stone at around waist level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exposed conditions, and this certainly qualifies, they would erect shelters to keep off the rain, snow and the worst of the wind. These would have been made of oilskin tarpaulin with a stick framework, probably on three sides, backed to the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools were iron chisels and a hammer, with the working stone set on a bed on firm earth and granite chips, which would absorb the blows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a hard job. As well as the obvious difficulties of weather and repetitive, physical work; the sett-maker&amp;rsquo;s hearing will have suffered and worse, many will have suffered from silicosis from working granite and died early from lung problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stone here is the waste rock - where setts failed, often through cracks in the rock or where edges were trimmed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional stonemasons still work very similarly to this, but now have tungsten tipped chisels and, when working with granite, a full-face respirator system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I worked for DNPA in the late 1980s, they often employed a traditional stonemason who would work just inside the entrance of the Works Depot in Bovey Tracey. He had a 45 gallon oil drum full of granite chips on which he&amp;rsquo;d place his work, which might be a perfectly spherical ball to sit atop a gatepost. He&amp;rsquo;d stand there all day, chipping away. Pausing every now and then to offer up a hardboard template to check his progress, or check diameter with a set of large calipers. He wore a full face respirator, with a battery pack and inlet on his belt at the back, similar to those used by industrial welders, which blew filtered air into the mask. &lt;cite&gt;&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;bumps&amp;rdquo; on the left skyline are high-level waste tips while the enormous waste tip to the right is named &amp;ldquo;Big Tip&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Oak Quarry (later known as Foggintor) was worked from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, extracting granite that was taken away on the nearby railway line. This track was a horse-driven rail or tramway, so some deliveries will also have left this way to the road, as well as bringing supplies into the quarry and its accompanying village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remains on the site include ruins of numerous buildings, large spoil tips and tracks, including that leading to the nearby Swell Tor Quarry, was closely associated. Foggintor was known to have included up to 30 cottages, a large Manager&amp;rsquo;s house, smithy, powder house, dressing sheds and stables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Quarry was first dug in 1820, then known as Royal Oak Quarry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through the 1830s through 1840s, up to 600 men were employed by the local quarries, some living at Foggintor and most journeying in each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 1861 Census, 267 people were registered as living at Foggintor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As well as Foggintor, Hill Quarry and Royal Oak Quarry, this was also known as Foggator - probably a local dialect corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Houses of Parliament and Nelson&amp;rsquo;s Column were built from granite taken from this quarry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More locally, stone from here was used to build Tor Royal at Princetown, and likely some other Princetown buildings, although the Prison&amp;rsquo;s stone was mostly dug from the nearer Herne Hole Quarry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foggintor Quarry was owned at one time by the Johnson Brothers who also took the lease on Haytor Quarry, but closed it and then sold stone from Foggintor Quarry under Haytor&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The quarry closed in 1966, putting 40 men out of work. One factor given was competition from cheaper sources abroad, and an increasing use of concrete instead of stone in architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stones that form Big Tip are huge, especially on the lower levels. Approaching from the side you can see some must weigh many tons, and cracks in between are big enough to easily conceal an adult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scant foundations were once a schoolhouse and a Wesleyan Chapel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quarry workers originally sent their children to the School at Princetown, which was then probably built in the Barracks. But when Dartmoor Prison was re-opened in 1850, a new building for the School was needed and was built here. At its peak in 1861, 183 pupils were known to regularly attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that this is not the later &amp;ldquo;Foggintor School&amp;rdquo;. That was also known as Four Winds and forms the large tree-lined car park half a mile south of our parking. We discuss that school &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/the-merrivale-bronze-age-sun-calendar-and-foggintor-school/&#34; &gt;in our Merrivale Calendar walk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1880 and 1883, this building was also recorded as a Wesleyan Chapel, and later a Workshop and again as a private residence, so it clearly served multiple purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1915 it was closed forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see where a branch railway line was laid out along Big Tip  to carry waste for tipping. The railway gauge was about 2-feet for easy man-handling. It is recorded that only 10% of quarried granite was used in building, the rest was waste. Looking at the size of these tips, it is easy to believe that disposing of waste rock was a large part of the works here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the research for this walk was taken from Kath Brewer&amp;rsquo;s book, The Railways, Quarries and Cottages of Foggintor, Orchard Publications, Chudleigh, Newton Abbot, 1997.  The cottage about the arch was her home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the arch is unknown. There is a suggestion that a waterwheel was located here, but there seems to be no evidence to support that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1840 Walkhampton Tithe Map shows Little King Tor and Great King Tor. It also shows the 1823 Plymouth &amp;amp; Dartmoor Railway, extended from King Tor quarries to Princetown by December 1826. It shows neither Foggin Tor nor the branch line to Foggintor Quarry. These were active well within Walkhampton Parish, although quarrying had nothing to do with tithing and therefore wasn&amp;rsquo;t suitable for the purpose of the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a fair layby at the start of the track to Yellowmeade and Foggintor - which is in fact an old sand quarry. Please don&amp;rsquo;t block the track, it is in regular use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;rsquo;s full, there&amp;rsquo;s usually some space opposite, and some more a short way towards Princetown by the old pump house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This road is famously recorded as having a pair of ghostly hands that take control of the steering wheel or handlebar or cars or motorbikes, forcing them off the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note from Simon: My mother once drove this road alone at night in the 1980s and swears she saw a coffin lying in her path. She swerved and avoided it, but didn&amp;rsquo;t dare return to investigate. I know of no other reports of coffins on this road but the incident was very close to the ancient Lich Way of which she wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware at the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-the-lich-way&#34;&gt;About the Lich Way
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Lich Way is a 17 mile path across Dartmoor from beyond Bellever through to Lydford.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We join it on our way to the Powdermills for only a short distance, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting piece of Ancient Dartmoor history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to 1260, residents of the farms and villages in this area of Dartmoor belonged to the Parish of Lydford. This meant that as well as travelling off the moor to attend services, they were expected to bury their dead in the consecrated ground of Lydford, then a major and powerful town. Coffins were carried by ox or pony cart, strapped directly onto pack ponies, or carried by men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The route bears many memories of its purpose. There is a Coffin Wood, and many suitable large flat rocks along the route are identified as &amp;ldquo;Coffin Stones&amp;rdquo; where the heavy burden was laid so the carriers could rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lich or Lych? Both methods of spelling are in wide usage, both on Dartmoor and elsewhere. The word is thought to be derived from the German &amp;ldquo;leich&amp;rdquo; or Dutch &amp;ldquo;lijk&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Corpse&amp;rdquo;, so perhaps Lich is the more correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For more information about the Lich way, please see the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/2016/03/17/lych_way/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

		alt=&#34;Across the road, the new path that was made in 1999. The old path was down the road to the left at Cherry Brook Bridge - a path that had become very boggy. In the distance is Longaford Tor (left), Higher White Tor (centre) and Arch Tor (right). The diversion of the path can be seen as a kink on modern walking route maps&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-gunpowder&#34;&gt;About Gunpowder
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunpowder is a mixture of three components of varying proportions depending on intended use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder#Composition_and_characteristics&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;More info - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the production of gunpowder is complicated and is unsurprisingly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Powdermills site is also complicated. Everything (except for the water) entered the site at the Southern entrance. Various stages in production occurred going up through the site to the three incorporation mills at the north end and then coming back down through the site until final storage in a main magazine ready for shipment to buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gunpowder, black powder or rock powder (local name) used for quarrying and mine blasting, is still used in fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composition is 75% saltpetre, 15% charcoal and 10% sulphur (aka brimstone or burning stone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamite, more powerful, was patented in May 1867 by Alfred Nobel. Its success as a superior explosive led to eventual closure of the mills in 1897.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ingredients, saltpetre (mostly from  India), sulphur (mostly from the Vesuvius and Stromboli regions of Italy) and the charcoal (made from local wood, especially alder or alder buckthorn), were ground separately in a grinding mill house. These were then blended in the required proportions in large barrels tumbled by waterwheels. This incorporated them  into a single compound using a combination of mixing, crushing and churning. This was a hazardous process that was governed by strict regulations and regular inspections. Only wooden and copper tools were allowed , so as to prevent sparks causing explosions.  The men had to wear leather aprons and sof-soled shoes, no hobnail boots. There is a story that one man, Silas Sleep, who took his breakfast and dinner to eat at work, always ate them both together, in case he was &amp;lsquo;blowed up&amp;rsquo; and sent to meet his maker before lunch time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Incorporation&amp;rdquo; was the first stage of production, in one of the three incorporation mills (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) at the top of the site, it resulted in a form of &amp;ldquo;cake&amp;rdquo;. It was probably at this stage that the powders were dampened with water to reduce &amp;ldquo;dust&amp;rdquo;  and prevent accidental explosions. This also helped the very soluble salpetre to mix into the porous charcoal. The resulting damp paste or &amp;ldquo;mill cake&amp;rdquo; was shaped into &amp;ldquo;corns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &amp;ldquo;ripe charge&amp;rdquo; that could be stored for a short period. It was then pressed down in e.g. a 2-ft square box to &amp;ldquo;press cake&amp;rdquo; about an inch thick. Originally this was a hand-powered process, like a cider press, but later a water wheel was used to drive the presses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stage was &amp;ldquo;corning&amp;rdquo; when slabs of cake were broken up with wooden mallets into a granular form. Later, water-powered machines were used. This involved rollers and then sieving through different sized meshes. The powder was then tumbled in rotating barrels or cylinders. These were covered with gauze to collect any small dust-sized particles. This was another water-wheel powered process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stage was &amp;ldquo;glazing&amp;rdquo;, where the grains were tumbled again, with graphite or black lead to give each grain of powder a waterproof coating. This made the powder suitabe for use in damp mines and quarrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last stage was &amp;ldquo;drying&amp;rdquo;, sometimes in the open air. Usually, this was done in heated &amp;ldquo;Gloom stoves&amp;rdquo;. These were heated by an iron furnace with the powder laid on trays stacked around it. Later, steam stoves were used to heat pipes near the trays. The process used a flue to take away any sparks and fumes to a chimney - and this is seen at the south, bottom end of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final product was packed in large oak barrels that were covered with leather to prevent spillage and from stray sparks entering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gunpowder quality was tested periodically using the proving mortar that lies beside the road going into the Powdermills site. The strength was determined by firing a 68 lb iron ball over a distance that was then measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the actual gunpowder makers or millers, the Powdermills employed coopers, blacksmiths, carpenters, wagoneers, carters, wheelwrights, stable staff and labourers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-powdermills-history&#34;&gt;The Powdermills History
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George Frean&lt;/strong&gt;, a Plymouth Alderman, founded the Plymouth &amp;amp; Dartmoor Gunpowder Company and opened Powdermills in 1844; it closed in 1897. It had employed about 100 men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Frean later teamed up with James Peek, one of three brothers importing tea - wanted a biscuit business for &amp;ldquo;tea and biscuits&amp;rdquo; - wrote to George Frean, &amp;ldquo;miller and ships biscuit maker&amp;rdquo;, who had married a niece of theirs, to manage &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peek_Freans&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Peak Freans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole complex was powered by water which was brought in by three leats. Initially, one leat came from the east bank of the Cherry Brook to a rectangular reservoir north of the three isolated incorporating mills. The water then returned to the Cherry Brook. The second leat came from the west side of the Cherry Brook to a circular reservoir behind the buildings. Water was taken for four years without Duchy permission. Permission was quickly granted because the Prince Consort, Prince Albert, had encouraged the venture. Later, water was also leated from the East Dart River to the north end reservoir. The water was then leated to water wheels used for grinding and powering other machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leat through the site is described in the book Industrial Archaeology of Dartmoor as now being dry and &amp;ldquo;two points at which it crosses the Cherry Brook, which flows between the buildings, can be seen. At one of these points, after feeding half the wheelhouses, the leat passes under the Cherry Brook through a wooden launder, which is still in place, in hard and excellent condition in spite of its years of saturation. Further downstream the leat&amp;rsquo;s channel back under the brook is of stone, big enough for a man to enter. The water had to be conveyed some way before being allowed to discharge, in order to prevent pollution of the Cherry Brook&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterwheels were used in the three massively-built incorporating mills (1,2,3 on the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;map.jpg&#34; &gt;map&lt;/a&gt;), glazing mill (4), pressing house (5) and two in the incorporating/composition mill and cartridge pressing house/corning/dusting house and glazing mill complex (6,7), and the final preparation rooms (8), making eight altogether. There is also a ninth, disused wheelpit at the final preparation rooms with later lean-tos in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate from the powder works to the south, along the road in, is the row of 19th century buildings that included cottages, a manager&amp;rsquo;s house, school, cooperage and a small Methodist chapel. Today, there is a pottery, offices and farm buildings. South of the cottages beside the road is the proving mortar and nearby is a wheel-binding stone, used for fixing hot iron rims to cart and wagon wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site - starting below at South Chimney after entering at the top of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be confusion identifying buildings when referring to the 2019 book and the 1990 survey listed above. The book starts at the south end of the site (page 98) with &amp;ldquo;Building 1&amp;rdquo; and the archaeogical survey starts from the north. The survey numbers are in (brackets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no known map saying what each building was used for, so there is conjecture based on the gunpowder-making processes and  the requirements for them to be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ready-made charcoal was brought in, then the South Chimney could have been for processing saltpetre, dissolving it and recrystallising it to make it more pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three phases of development and extension have been identified and it is likely that the function of the buildings changed over time. A flue and chimney indicate heat was involved. The flue to the chimney is about 1 metre deep and 1 metre wide. Its eastern portion is now open and rubble-filled, but the western portion is still capped. It enters the base of the chimney which is set on a plinth. The chimney is about 10.5 metres high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Chimney with the 17 (18) Saltpetre / Charcoal Works behind. Across the track is the 2 (17) Cartridge Press House / Watch House / Store and up the slope behind that is the 1 (16) Watch House / Checking House. At the left edge are the roofs of the Powdermills Cottages, Pottery / Cafe, and offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly a saltpetre crystallising house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long rectangular single-storey building located at the southern end of the site and aligned north to south.. Two, possibly three, phases have been identified. Water was culverted through the building under the floor. Its north wall was probably the dwarf wall which now subdivides it from the extension to the north. Dwarf walls in one interior consist of one long spine wall and two side walls. Another dwarf wall runs east to west across the structure from the northernmost door to the east wall. These appear to form a raised floor with water, air or heat circulating beneath. A small, square, stone-lined feature to the west of the south-west corner may be a well, or possibly a pit in which staves were soaked. The building is described in the book as the Watch House, where materials in and out of the site were monitored. It might also have been used as a store.&lt;/p&gt;

The west wall stands to full height; the east wall survives only as footings. No doors or windows are present in the three standing walls. There is plaster rendering on the interior.

&lt;p&gt;Incorporating/composition mill (south), possible cartridge press house (south of N building) and possible corning/dusting house/glazing mill. Consists of two pairs of structures on either side of two wheelpits. The tailrace of the southern wheepit discharges back to the Cherrybrook. The wheel between the southern mill was powered by a continuation of the leat powering buildings to the north. The wheelpit tailrace discharged via a channel into Cherry Brook. The culvert has an arched roof of granite blocks overlain by slabs.&lt;/p&gt;

The position of the sluice is identifiable. The tailrace is not visible. This where a waterwheel powered a press to squeeze moisture out of the gunpowder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small building, aligned north to south just south of the glazing mill (below). There is a large rectangular stone table, 20-25 centimetres thick, on a masonry base.The table top is smooth. On this, the slabs of pressed gunpowder were broken down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long rectangular building, aligned north / south. The structure contains supports for a raised floor, or to support machinery such as glazing barrels. The internal supports may alternatively have been to provide under-floor ventilation. There is a wheelpit at the south end of the building. This where &amp;ldquo;broken&amp;rdquo; pieces of gunpowder from the Breaking House were sieved and large pieces were returned to the Breaking House and fine powder was returned to the Press House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Circular Reservoir on the hill above between this building and the preceding building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is probable that these buildings were used for dusting, glazing, sieving and packing the gunpowder prior to carting it it off-site. Horses may have been stabled here as well as barrels and other materials being stored here. There are two mills powered by a waterwheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar in plan to &amp;lsquo;Buildings 1 and 2&amp;rsquo;, consisting of two units flanking a central wheelpit. The wheelpit is largely filled with rubble. The wheel was powered by water from the tailrace of the wheelpit of &amp;lsquo;Building 2&amp;rsquo;. The three incorporating mill houses (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) were of massive construction with many granite blocks being 6-feet long and the was about 6-feet thick, to withstand inadvertent explosions. The roofs were very flimsy, of wood and tar, to blow off without damaging the main structure. They could be replaced easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: 5 (1) Incorporating Mill:&lt;/strong&gt; Consists of a pair of gable-ended structures flanking a large central wheelpit. Both of massive granite blocks with walls about 2 metres thick at their bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tar dribbles indicate original roofing was of tarred tarpaulin or wood. This was probably to allow any accidental explosion to go upwards and leave the walls standing, a technique still used by artisinal powder makers in India and China today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wheelpit is aligned north-east to south-west and runs the whole width of the units. Wheel axle appears to have projected into their ground floors. Powered by a launder to the north-east which flowed out through a culvert to the south-west. This is roofed for 3.5 - 4 metres, then becomes an open channel which runs downhill to feed the reservoir belonging to &amp;lsquo;Building 2&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raised bank at the left brought the leat that fed a launder to the waterwheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proving mortar is just off the road, on the left, on the last bend when driving in approaching the Pottery, cafe and mill cottages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It fired a (probably) 68 lb ball to test the powder. The distance travelled by the ball was a measure of the strength of the powder and undoubtedly a good sales tactic for potential buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This walk was reached from a small roadside layby marked by the yellow cross below the &amp;ldquo;Lich Way Plaque&amp;rdquo; label on the map. Normally, for a group, it would be reached from the main car park in Postbridge or the car park in the forest just across the road from it. There is also a car park at Higher Cherry Brook Bridge,  marked with the P symbol and yellow cross on the map&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that there is no parking available at the Powdermills Pottery and shop except when visiting them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
