&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This short walk starts at the Highest Pub in Southern England and climbs the gentle hill behind it, visiting several ancient sites on the way such as the Kings&amp;rsquo; Oven to the impressive Hurston Stone Row. We then return along a low ridge to another cairn atop Water Hill, before dropping back down to the starting point. The views are impressive, and although never far from the road, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to lose sight of modernity and step back in time in one&amp;rsquo;s imagination to when this area was a thriving tin mining valley, or even further back to the bronze age when it was also busy with several nearby settlements.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This pub claims to be the most famous pub on Dartmoor and is certainly one of the most visited, especially on a Summer&amp;rsquo;s day. When the prison was working, visitors would often stop by here on their way to visit friends and relatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At 434m above sea level, it&amp;rsquo;s the highest pub in Southern England and the second highest overall. It claims to have kept its fire burning continuously since 1845, which must make for exciting work as the pub&amp;rsquo;s chimney sweep.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally named New House and built in 1751, it was then positioned on the opposite side of the road where the foundations can still be seen. In 1845, the pub was rebuilt and renamed to the &amp;ldquo;Moreton Inn&amp;rdquo; to serve the thriving tin mining industry that was literally on its doorstep, with Vitifer and Golden Dagger mines only a short distance downhill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shortly afterwards it was renamed to its present title for the Headland Warren that was built nearby to give the miners a steady supply of meat.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The letters WB are difficult to see now, occupying the upper six inches on the face of the stone. This is one of a series of 15 similar stones that mark the bounds of Headland Warren, where rabbits were bred to feed the miners. Warren House Inn is named after the warren. The &amp;ldquo;15&amp;rdquo; bound stones includes the large Bennet&amp;rsquo;s Cross, which stands tall and proud to the side of the road, also marked &amp;ldquo;WB&amp;rdquo;. The stones date from around 1780 &lt;cite> &amp;ndash; (Dave Brewer, 2002, Dartmoor Boundary Markers, pp. 265-268)&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Benet’s Cross stands at the roadside, a tall roughly hewn cross with a distinctive bend in the shaft, inscribed on its north face the letters ‘WB’. The original purpose of the cross is uncertain — it may have been a route guide post, or a bond mark of lands owned by Buckfast Abbey, or perhaps both. The name should be spelt with a single ‘n’ and a single ‘t’ — though few people seem to do so — for it is derived from the Benedictine order of monks, indicating its former association with the original monastery at Buckfast — this was at first a Benedictine abbey, as also is the present one, but was a Cistercian monastery from the thirteenth century until the Dissolution. The cross also acted not only as a boundary marker for Headland Warren, to which the letters refer (WB = Warren Bounds), but also for the Vitifer and Birch Tor mining setts, as well as being a bond mark on the Chagford/North Bovey parish line, a purpose which it still serves today. A curious coincidence is the fact that a William Bennett was a representative of Chagford Stannary in the time of King Henry VIII, and he would have undoubtedly had some indirect connections with the earliest tin-streaming activities in the area.&amp;rdquo; &lt;cite>&amp;mdash; Mike Brown (2001) Guide to Dartmoor&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>This green cast iron item is a Telegraph Marker. There are thirteen of these items between Moretonhampstead and Tavistock. They marked the route of underground telegraph cables placed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After bad blizzards of 1891, a need was seen to create more reliable communications after overhead telegraph cables were damaged and made inoperable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The start of the walk is an ancient trackway to the open workings of the Water Hill Mine that has extensive diggings on this hillside. There is a large gert (A mining remain where tin was washed out of the rock) right behind the Warren House Inn that approaches from the west - this being the direction of the Caroline Mine. The Water Hill MIne workings extend rightwards in this photograph, towards Moretonhampstead, towards the workings of Bushdown Mine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s mysteries, the V stones - no-one knows what these are. It has been suggested they might be for the base of machinery, the base of a flagpole, a mould and I&amp;rsquo;m sure, many other things. (See plan below for location)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Two theories:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The DTRG (Dartmoor Tinworking Research Group) Newsletter May 2020 No. 58 has a note on the &amp;ldquo;Kings Oven Stones&amp;rdquo; by Nick Walter on pages 9-10 that proposes a possible function for these stones. They could have been supports for a hand windlass that could have been used for raising loads from a small shaft in the nearby mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The next issue of the same DTRG Newsletter, dated November 2020 No. 59, has a note on the &amp;ldquo;Kings Oven Stones&amp;rdquo; by Tom Greaves on page 19. The stones may have derived from a single stone that is now broken. The cut recesses could have housed the base (wood or metal) of a flagpole. They are situated near the foundations of the larger of two ruined buildings which might have been the mine office. It is recorded that at least one mine in this area flew such a flag when they were actively working.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>King&amp;rsquo;s Oven or Furnum Regis (in Latin). This derives from the fact that this is thought to be the site of an early smelting house, hence &amp;ldquo;oven&amp;rdquo;, the produce of which would be taxed by the King via the stannary towns, such as Chagford. Furnum Regis appears in the 1240 Perambulation of Dartmoor, although more likely mistaken for the landmark cairn at the summit of Water Hill.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Description: &amp;ldquo;The enclosure at King&amp;rsquo;s Oven is probably the site of medieval tin mining activities. Burnard comments that &amp;rsquo;the enclosure is circular and an acre in extent&amp;rsquo;. Burnard notes that the stone &amp;rsquo;looks something like the nether stone of a crazing mill&amp;rsquo;. A nether stone is the lower stone of a rotary crazing mill that was used for grinding tin ore. Crazing mills could only grind the alluvial gravels and they were replaced by stamping mills when coarser ores started being mined. In Newman&amp;rsquo;s //Dartmoor Tin Industry Field Guide// he states that only three crazing mills are known on Dartmoor at Sheepstor, Outcombe and Gobbet. Perhaps the stone photographed by Burnard in 1888 is evidence for a fourth crazing mill but the stone is no longer in situ today. King&amp;rsquo;s Oven was previously known as Furnum Regis and was mentioned by this name in a Perambulation of Henry III in 1240. However by 1609 in the Dartmoor Forestry Survey the location was known as King&amp;rsquo;s Oven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The fact that Furnum Regis, the King&amp;rsquo;s Oven (taken to imply a smelting place for tin), is a landmark in the 1240 Perambulation shows that tin was important as far back as the 1200s. The diggings in the area must date from that period - 800 years ago!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Somewhere in this area is a &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; cairn described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities. The cairn was discovered and excavated by the Dartmoor Exploration Committee in 1900 and then it was &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; again, shortly afterwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During investigations on the cairn by Baring Gould, a &amp;ldquo;stone axe and a cinerary urn&amp;rdquo; (the latter upturned and covering a small heap of cremated bones on a flat stone, covered by a slab) were found. A photo of the restored Middle Bronze Age urn (1500-1000 BC) can be seen &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/Images3/Hurstone.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here (Credit: Legendary Dartmoor)&lt;/a> The pattern around the rim is believed made by impressing the clay with a twisted cord. It was restored 1960-1962 and was put on display in the Plymouth Museum.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>It is assumed that this landmark cairn, which is visible for some distance, is the &amp;ldquo;Furnum Regis&amp;rdquo; mentioned in the 1240 Perambulation of Dartmoor. This was occasioned by order of King Henry III when he granted the lands of the Forest of Dartmoor to his brother Richard. It was decreed that the Sheriff of Devon should do this accompanied by twelve knights and their attendants. Richard became an Earl in 1225 and was known as Richard of Cornwall (died 1272, aged 63)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Legend records that there are four fields, each one shaped for the suites of a pack of cards. A young tin mining wastrel, name of Jan Reynolds, dared to play cards during a church sermon. The Devil descended and bore Jan away on his large and fierce black horse, never to be seen again. As he was borne away, Jan dropped his cards, forming these enclosures. (Full story at the link below)&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>The less prosaic reality is that they were farming enclosures used to grow vegetables for the nearby mines.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Coaker&amp;rsquo;s dedication to breeding good quality Dartmoor Ponies is well known and is several generations long. I recall visiting his mother, Diane Coaker, at Sherberton farm to view some of her ponies with my own mother in the 1980s. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Anton himself is very well known as the author of several books, newspaper articles and is a very knowledgeable and erudite writer on Moorland and Hill Farming matters.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dartmoor has had many fine dry stone wall builders, but perhaps the most famous of all was John Bishop (1821-1892). He was one of the first to use the shaped and squared building method in his walls. He tightly fitted large blocks of granite in such a way that very little daylight could be seen through the wall. He helped enclose many of the newtakes on Dartmoor and would have been in strong demand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When asked how he lifted such heavy stones, John Bishop is alleged to have replied, “Aw, ‘tis surprisin’ what ee can do with a laiver or two.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of the walls in this area were built or repaired by Mr Bishop who lived close by - we&amp;rsquo;ll visit his house on this walk - and are of a visibly better quality than most earlier walls, which were mostly built from natural moorstone, using &amp;ldquo;trigs&amp;rdquo; of small stone to wedge them in place. But no matter how well a dry stone wall is made, it needs repairing often due to weather and especially animals and people climbing it and loosening stone, so other men will have been involved over the years in keeping these walls stockproof.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dolly Trebble was a particularly attractive girl who caught the eye of many men of Dartmoor in the 18th Century. Despite being married to William Trebble, she was courted by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt (1762-1833) - an important man who shaped much of Princetown and Dartmoor, and no less than George IV, the Prince Regent who visited here several times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She was written about by Sabine Baring Gould and Dolly was clearly a woman of some fame. Tim Sandles has an entertaining version of Dolly&amp;rsquo;s story on his Legendary Dartmoor site if you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This valley starts up at Peat Cott with the infamous Foxtor Mire at its head, which acts as a huge sponge providing a steady flow throughout even the driest of summers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was that which prompted a plan in the 1960s to flood this entire valley to provide another reservoir on Dartmoor, far larger than the modest intake that has stood there for a hundred years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not surprisingly, this caused a lot of opposition. Perhaps the most vocal opponent was Lady Sylvia Sayer who, with the Dartmoor Preservation Association, resisted this at every turn. You will by now have noticed that you&amp;rsquo;re not under several meters of water, so it should be no surprise to learn that in 1970, the opposers won and permission was refused. Planning was retried several times through the 70s and 80s until in 1985, the DPA used funds from a bequest to acquire 50 acres of this valley to protect it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ore from the adit would be smashed down small enough to fit into the top hole of this stone which sat above the base stone. The top stone was then rotated, possibly by pony or donkey or water power, to grind the ore just as grain is turned into wheat. The resulting fine sand was then smelted to form ingots.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>When the Swincombe Intake was built in the 1920s, the builders needed to run a pipe from there to the Venford Reservoir some 6 kilometers away. They opted to reuse and extend this adit to run that pipe through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tunnel continues through the hill in a straight line for 540 meters, emerging in a field 150m North West of The Forest Inn.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>An impressive, but little known double stone row - one of several on Dartmoor. A medium walk through quiet woodland with some climbs on mostly firm forestry tracks.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The shed we park by was originally built for the forestry workers, but now is used mostly for storage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fernworthy forest was first planted in 1921 by the Duchy of Cornwall. At that time there was a national shortage of timber following the First World War and much was needed quickly, leading to a nationwide conifer planting scheme.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The forest comprises mostly of Sitka Spruce with some Douglas Fir and Japanese Larch. All are well suited to the Dartmoor conditions and provide a change of habitat for much wildlife. There are also pockets of deciduous woodland, notably around the reservoir.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Reservoir was built 1936-1942 by Torquay Water Authority and was the last granite dam built on Dartmoor at a cost of £246,000 - twice the original tender. It covers 76 acres and holds 380 million gallons. It&amp;rsquo;s 63 feet deep and water is piped to Trenchford Reservoir.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Start our walk by walking about 350m back along the road you entered by, and turning right into the Woodland through a gateway&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Lowton Brook West Settlement was described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 2 - The North, 35.4 - Lowton Brook West, page 157.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are eleven huts in this area, with this one being the furthest north, and the largest at 9.1 metres diameter. They date from the Bronze age, approximately 3300 BC to 1200 BC. The climate of Dartmoor was much milder then and many small settlements remain from human occupation of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each Hut Circle is the site of what was probably a fairly typical Bronze Age Roundhouse, with walls of stone and a thatched roof. A central firepit will have provided cooking and heat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the stone has been robbed by successive moor men, who used it for other buildings or walling, leaving the heavier base stones.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The hut circles probably came long after the stone row was erected, and it&amp;rsquo;s thought that the builders respected the row. Certainly, they did not steal its stones to build their huts, which would have been convenient.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The stone row is described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 2 - Asacombe Hill stone rows. This double row is similar to its neighbour on Hurston Ridge, a kilometre to the east. It is possible that a third row was planned but never installed, because the rows do not align well with the centre of the cairn.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One of the most picturesque and popular Dartmoor destinations. The abandoned quarries have been retaken by nature despite having been worked as recently as 1966. The quarries once supported an entire village of based here at Foggintor, with a School, Chapel and 30 cottages. The landscape will have looked very differently here two hundred years ago at the height of its industry. Now only evocative ruins remain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Across the road from the parking area are the ruins of the old non-denominational Mission Hall, built in 1887 and demolished in 1965.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to problems at Foggintor school, the Mission Hall opened as a school on 17th August 1896 to house 41 pupils and soon that grew to 95 children. The school closed on 27th September 1912 and the children went to temporary schools at Merrivale and back to Foggintor Chapel until the new school opened at what is now known as Four Winds, on 19th April 1915.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the photograph above, Great Mis Tor is seen at top right.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cottages stood on the high ground on the left of the photograph (but to the right of the track) and were separated from their gardens by a back lane. The cottages were planned in 1846 and built by April 1849. They were probably demolished in 1953, the same year as Hill Cottages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to various Censuses, they were originally known as Mount Pleasant Cottages, then West View Cottages, and after that, Red Cottages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were built with cob and by 1871 the weather got into them so badly they were &amp;ldquo;covered with corrugated iron&amp;rdquo; and painted with red lead, thus becoming known as Red Cottages - this appears in the 1871 Census.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kath Brewer writes in &amp;ldquo;The Railways, Quarries and Cottages of Foggintor&amp;rdquo; that in later years they were actually black, having been covered with pitch, again against the weather.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were six cottages but with twelve dwellings - with &amp;ldquo;one up, one down&amp;rdquo;. In the 1861 Census, there were thirteen families with 50 adults and 38 children at West View, as the cottages were known at that time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A quarryman once stood at this point making Setts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Setts are granite blocks that were much used for paving roads and paths, and can still be seen in many cities, for they last a very long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rough cut setts blocks be brought here, such as cut from the Cake Stone above. To cut down on transport, the bankers typically set up very close by to the raw material, and their workplaces - bankers - were rough and ready; somewhere to stand and work the stone at around waist level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In exposed conditions, and this certainly qualifies, they would erect shelters to keep off the rain, snow and the worst of the wind. These would have been made of oilskin tarpaulin with a stick framework, probably on three sides, backed to the wind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tools were iron chisels and a hammer, with the working stone set on a bed on firm earth and granite chips, which would absorb the blows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a hard job. As well as the obvious difficulties of weather and repetitive, physical work; the sett-maker&amp;rsquo;s hearing will have suffered and worse, many will have suffered from silicosis from working granite and died early from lung problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stone here is the waste rock - where setts failed, often through cracks in the rock or where edges were trimmed off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional stonemasons still work very similarly to this, but now have tungsten tipped chisels and, when working with granite, a full-face respirator system.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When I worked for DNPA in the late 1980s, they often employed a traditional stonemason who would work just inside the entrance of the Works Depot in Bovey Tracey. He had a 45 gallon oil drum full of granite chips on which he&amp;rsquo;d place his work, which might be a perfectly spherical ball to sit atop a gatepost. He&amp;rsquo;d stand there all day, chipping away. Pausing every now and then to offer up a hardboard template to check his progress, or check diameter with a set of large calipers. He wore a full face respirator, with a battery pack and inlet on his belt at the back, similar to those used by industrial welders, which blew filtered air into the mask. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;bumps&amp;rdquo; on the left skyline are high-level waste tips while the enormous waste tip to the right is named &amp;ldquo;Big Tip&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Royal Oak Quarry (later known as Foggintor) was worked from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, extracting granite that was taken away on the nearby railway line. This track was a horse-driven rail or tramway, so some deliveries will also have left this way to the road, as well as bringing supplies into the quarry and its accompanying village.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remains on the site include ruins of numerous buildings, large spoil tips and tracks, including that leading to the nearby Swell Tor Quarry, was closely associated. Foggintor was known to have included up to 30 cottages, a large Manager&amp;rsquo;s house, smithy, powder house, dressing sheds and stables.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Quarry was first dug in 1820, then known as Royal Oak Quarry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Through the 1830s through 1840s, up to 600 men were employed by the local quarries, some living at Foggintor and most journeying in each day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the 1861 Census, 267 people were registered as living at Foggintor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As well as Foggintor, Hill Quarry and Royal Oak Quarry, this was also known as Foggator - probably a local dialect corruption.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Houses of Parliament and Nelson&amp;rsquo;s Column were built from granite taken from this quarry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More locally, stone from here was used to build Tor Royal at Princetown, and likely some other Princetown buildings, although the Prison&amp;rsquo;s stone was mostly dug from the nearer Herne Hole Quarry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Foggintor Quarry was owned at one time by the Johnson Brothers who also took the lease on Haytor Quarry, but closed it and then sold stone from Foggintor Quarry under Haytor&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The quarry closed in 1966, putting 40 men out of work. One factor given was competition from cheaper sources abroad, and an increasing use of concrete instead of stone in architecture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The stones that form Big Tip are huge, especially on the lower levels. Approaching from the side you can see some must weigh many tons, and cracks in between are big enough to easily conceal an adult.&lt;/li>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These scant foundations were once a schoolhouse and a Wesleyan Chapel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The quarry workers originally sent their children to the School at Princetown, which was then probably built in the Barracks. But when Dartmoor Prison was re-opened in 1850, a new building for the School was needed and was built here. At its peak in 1861, 183 pupils were known to regularly attend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note that this is not the later &amp;ldquo;Foggintor School&amp;rdquo;. That was also known as Four Winds and forms the large tree-lined car park half a mile south of our parking. We discuss that school &lt;a class="link" href="https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/the-merrivale-bronze-age-sun-calendar-and-foggintor-school/" >in our Merrivale Calendar walk&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between 1880 and 1883, this building was also recorded as a Wesleyan Chapel, and later a Workshop and again as a private residence, so it clearly served multiple purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By 1915 it was closed forever.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can see where a branch railway line was laid out along Big Tip to carry waste for tipping. The railway gauge was about 2-feet for easy man-handling. It is recorded that only 10% of quarried granite was used in building, the rest was waste. Looking at the size of these tips, it is easy to believe that disposing of waste rock was a large part of the works here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The purpose of the arch is unknown. There is a suggestion that a waterwheel was located here, but there seems to be no evidence to support that.&lt;/p>

These were active well within Walkhampton Parish, although quarrying had nothing to do with tithing and therefore wasn&amp;rsquo;t suitable for the purpose of the map.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There is a fair layby at the start of the track to Yellowmeade and Foggintor - which is in fact an old sand quarry. Please don&amp;rsquo;t block the track, it is in regular use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If that&amp;rsquo;s full, there&amp;rsquo;s usually some space opposite, and some more a short way towards Princetown by the old pump house.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This walk starts near the famous Warren House Inn and descends into the Redwater valley, home to many ancient tin workings and four distinct tin mines which were combined in 1845. This was a major industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries employing hundreds of people, and many ruins and reminders remain. The main route is firm and easy going, with a gentle hill on the final climb back to the car park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: The track along the valley, although firm underfoot, is often very wet all year round. Sensible footwear recommended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do feel free to explore the area and leave our track - there are many points of interest, some of which we&amp;rsquo;ve marked on the map and all are worth exploring.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the parking, on a clear day, you can see three rock walled enclosures across the valley. Together with a fourth (see map, central), these are known as the &amp;ldquo;Four Aces&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Playing Cards&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Legend tells&amp;hellip;
Jan Reynolds was a tin miner from Widecombe who was more interested in drinking and gambling than in going to church on a Sunday. Finding himself short of money he made a deal with the Devil: in return for money to fund his gambling the Devil could have his soul if he was found asleep in church.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jan soon forgot the pact and one Sunday he fell asleep while playing cards in church. There was a sound of horses’ hooves outside, and a flash of lightning so fierce that it tore off the top of the church tower, then the Devil strode into the church and snatched up the terrified miner, carrying him up into the sky and across the moor. Jan had four aces in his hand and he dropped them in what is now known as the Aces Field.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>One can quite clearly see a diamond shape, but it taxes the imagination to see the shape of a Heart, a Club and a Spade in these fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reality of these enclosures is that they were either to keep rabbits in or rabbits out. The farm just over the hill to the Easy is Headland Warren Farm, which was known to breed rabbits which formed a large part of the miner&amp;rsquo;s diet. I&amp;rsquo;m unclear whether the rabbits were kept in these enclosures, or they were built for growing crops which needed protecting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Take the path Eastwards into the valley for about half a mile&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="vitifer-mine">Vitifer Mine

&lt;p>This area contains the remains of four distinct mines:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Vitifer (Prev: Vytifer) Mine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Birch Tor Mine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy Birch Tor Mine (AKA Headland Mine)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Golden Dagger Mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Vitifer and Birch Tor were separate mines originally, then combined, then separated, and then combined again. Naming of these two seems interchangeable, with both workings being known by both names.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The flue here runs underneath and heated what was the &amp;ldquo;Miner&amp;rsquo;s dry&amp;rdquo; - a place where miners would hang their clothes, soaked from working underground in dripping and partially flooded adits and stopes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fireplace or boiler would have been placed at the far end of the flue, and the smoke run through it to the chimney, which released it high enough not to bother those at ground level.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This mine was named after a bronze dagger was found here from the early men who lived here four thousand years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dagger was taken to Plymouth Museum, and rumoured to have been destroyed during World War 2 bombing of that building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A replica dagger is owned by DNPA and can sometimes be seen at their information centres and displays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This area was mined for Tin from at least the fifteenth century via surface streaming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mines were dug to chase tin further underground from around the 1750s. Given the amount of surface water in this area, one imagines these were very wet mines and hard to keep dewatered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The underground workings ended in 1914 when many men were drafted for the First World War. Some surface working remained until 1939 when again, the needs of war took labour away from the moors.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A buddle is a simple structure to separate material out by its density.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fine sediment is introduced at the centre point by trough or pipe in suspension with water. As it flows towards the outer edge, heavier material is deposited first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some buddles are assisted by rotary brushes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once sufficient sediment has built up, it is shovelled out with the &amp;ldquo;headings&amp;rdquo; containing the more valuable minerals in the centre, and the less valuable or waste known as &amp;ldquo;tailings&amp;rdquo; towards the edge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one is known to have been fed by a slurry onto the cone by a small leat arrangement and swept by a waterwheel-driven &amp;ldquo;wood and rags sweeps&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;em>Note from Simon: My mother once drove this road alone at night in the 1980s and swears she saw a coffin lying in her path. She swerved and avoided it, but didn&amp;rsquo;t dare return to investigate. I know of no other reports of coffins on this road but the incident was very close to the ancient Lich Way of which she wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware at the time.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="about-the-lich-way">About the Lich Way
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Lich Way is a 17 mile path across Dartmoor from beyond Bellever through to Lydford.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We join it on our way to the Powdermills for only a short distance, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting piece of Ancient Dartmoor history.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prior to 1260, residents of the farms and villages in this area of Dartmoor belonged to the Parish of Lydford. This meant that as well as travelling off the moor to attend services, they were expected to bury their dead in the consecrated ground of Lydford, then a major and powerful town. Coffins were carried by ox or pony cart, strapped directly onto pack ponies, or carried by men.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The route bears many memories of its purpose. There is a Coffin Wood, and many suitable large flat rocks along the route are identified as &amp;ldquo;Coffin Stones&amp;rdquo; where the heavy burden was laid so the carriers could rest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lich or Lych? Both methods of spelling are in wide usage, both on Dartmoor and elsewhere. The word is thought to be derived from the German &amp;ldquo;leich&amp;rdquo; or Dutch &amp;ldquo;lijk&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Corpse&amp;rdquo;, so perhaps Lich is the more correct.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For more information about the Lich way, please see the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/2016/03/17/lych_way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="about-gunpowder">About Gunpowder
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Gunpowder is a mixture of three components of varying proportions depending on intended use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder#Composition_and_characteristics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>More info - Wikipedia&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the production of gunpowder is complicated and is unsurprisingly dangerous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Powdermills site is also complicated. Everything (except for the water) entered the site at the Southern entrance. Various stages in production occurred going up through the site to the three incorporation mills at the north end and then coming back down through the site until final storage in a main magazine ready for shipment to buyers.&lt;/p>

alt="This DNPA Notice on the first Incorporation Mill explains the process"

data-flex-basis="426px"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gunpowder, black powder or rock powder (local name) used for quarrying and mine blasting, is still used in fireworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The composition is 75% saltpetre, 15% charcoal and 10% sulphur (aka brimstone or burning stone).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dynamite, more powerful, was patented in May 1867 by Alfred Nobel. Its success as a superior explosive led to eventual closure of the mills in 1897.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ingredients, saltpetre (mostly from India), sulphur (mostly from the Vesuvius and Stromboli regions of Italy) and the charcoal (made from local wood, especially alder or alder buckthorn), were ground separately in a grinding mill house. These were then blended in the required proportions in large barrels tumbled by waterwheels. This incorporated them into a single compound using a combination of mixing, crushing and churning. This was a hazardous process that was governed by strict regulations and regular inspections. Only wooden and copper tools were allowed , so as to prevent sparks causing explosions. The men had to wear leather aprons and sof-soled shoes, no hobnail boots. There is a story that one man, Silas Sleep, who took his breakfast and dinner to eat at work, always ate them both together, in case he was &amp;lsquo;blowed up&amp;rsquo; and sent to meet his maker before lunch time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Incorporation&amp;rdquo; was the first stage of production, in one of the three incorporation mills (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) at the top of the site, it resulted in a form of &amp;ldquo;cake&amp;rdquo;. It was probably at this stage that the powders were dampened with water to reduce &amp;ldquo;dust&amp;rdquo; and prevent accidental explosions. This also helped the very soluble salpetre to mix into the porous charcoal. The resulting damp paste or &amp;ldquo;mill cake&amp;rdquo; was shaped into &amp;ldquo;corns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was &amp;ldquo;ripe charge&amp;rdquo; that could be stored for a short period. It was then pressed down in e.g. a 2-ft square box to &amp;ldquo;press cake&amp;rdquo; about an inch thick. Originally this was a hand-powered process, like a cider press, but later a water wheel was used to drive the presses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next stage was &amp;ldquo;corning&amp;rdquo; when slabs of cake were broken up with wooden mallets into a granular form. Later, water-powered machines were used. This involved rollers and then sieving through different sized meshes. The powder was then tumbled in rotating barrels or cylinders. These were covered with gauze to collect any small dust-sized particles. This was another water-wheel powered process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next stage was &amp;ldquo;glazing&amp;rdquo;, where the grains were tumbled again, with graphite or black lead to give each grain of powder a waterproof coating. This made the powder suitabe for use in damp mines and quarrying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last stage was &amp;ldquo;drying&amp;rdquo;, sometimes in the open air. Usually, this was done in heated &amp;ldquo;Gloom stoves&amp;rdquo;. These were heated by an iron furnace with the powder laid on trays stacked around it. Later, steam stoves were used to heat pipes near the trays. The process used a flue to take away any sparks and fumes to a chimney - and this is seen at the south, bottom end of the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final product was packed in large oak barrels that were covered with leather to prevent spillage and from stray sparks entering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The gunpowder quality was tested periodically using the proving mortar that lies beside the road going into the Powdermills site. The strength was determined by firing a 68 lb iron ball over a distance that was then measured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the actual gunpowder makers or millers, the Powdermills employed coopers, blacksmiths, carpenters, wagoneers, carters, wheelwrights, stable staff and labourers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-powdermills-history">The Powdermills History
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>George Frean&lt;/strong>, a Plymouth Alderman, founded the Plymouth &amp;amp; Dartmoor Gunpowder Company and opened Powdermills in 1844; it closed in 1897. It had employed about 100 men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>George Frean later teamed up with James Peek, one of three brothers importing tea - wanted a biscuit business for &amp;ldquo;tea and biscuits&amp;rdquo; - wrote to George Frean, &amp;ldquo;miller and ships biscuit maker&amp;rdquo;, who had married a niece of theirs, to manage &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peek_Freans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Peak Freans&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole complex was powered by water which was brought in by three leats. Initially, one leat came from the east bank of the Cherry Brook to a rectangular reservoir north of the three isolated incorporating mills. The water then returned to the Cherry Brook. The second leat came from the west side of the Cherry Brook to a circular reservoir behind the buildings. Water was taken for four years without Duchy permission. Permission was quickly granted because the Prince Consort, Prince Albert, had encouraged the venture. Later, water was also leated from the East Dart River to the north end reservoir. The water was then leated to water wheels used for grinding and powering other machinery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The leat through the site is described in the book Industrial Archaeology of Dartmoor as now being dry and &amp;ldquo;two points at which it crosses the Cherry Brook, which flows between the buildings, can be seen. At one of these points, after feeding half the wheelhouses, the leat passes under the Cherry Brook through a wooden launder, which is still in place, in hard and excellent condition in spite of its years of saturation. Further downstream the leat&amp;rsquo;s channel back under the brook is of stone, big enough for a man to enter. The water had to be conveyed some way before being allowed to discharge, in order to prevent pollution of the Cherry Brook&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Waterwheels were used in the three massively-built incorporating mills (1,2,3 on the &lt;a class="link" href="map.jpg" >map&lt;/a>), glazing mill (4), pressing house (5) and two in the incorporating/composition mill and cartridge pressing house/corning/dusting house and glazing mill complex (6,7), and the final preparation rooms (8), making eight altogether. There is also a ninth, disused wheelpit at the final preparation rooms with later lean-tos in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Separate from the powder works to the south, along the road in, is the row of 19th century buildings that included cottages, a manager&amp;rsquo;s house, school, cooperage and a small Methodist chapel. Today, there is a pottery, offices and farm buildings. South of the cottages beside the road is the proving mortar and nearby is a wheel-binding stone, used for fixing hot iron rims to cart and wagon wheels.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The site - starting below at South Chimney after entering at the top of the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There can be confusion identifying buildings when referring to the 2019 book and the 1990 survey listed above. The book starts at the south end of the site (page 98) with &amp;ldquo;Building 1&amp;rdquo; and the archaeogical survey starts from the north. The survey numbers are in (brackets).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no known map saying what each building was used for, so there is conjecture based on the gunpowder-making processes and the requirements for them to be carried out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If ready-made charcoal was brought in, then the South Chimney could have been for processing saltpetre, dissolving it and recrystallising it to make it more pure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three phases of development and extension have been identified and it is likely that the function of the buildings changed over time. A flue and chimney indicate heat was involved. The flue to the chimney is about 1 metre deep and 1 metre wide. Its eastern portion is now open and rubble-filled, but the western portion is still capped. It enters the base of the chimney which is set on a plinth. The chimney is about 10.5 metres high.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Long rectangular single-storey building located at the southern end of the site and aligned north to south.. Two, possibly three, phases have been identified. Water was culverted through the building under the floor. Its north wall was probably the dwarf wall which now subdivides it from the extension to the north. Dwarf walls in one interior consist of one long spine wall and two side walls. Another dwarf wall runs east to west across the structure from the northernmost door to the east wall. These appear to form a raised floor with water, air or heat circulating beneath. A small, square, stone-lined feature to the west of the south-west corner may be a well, or possibly a pit in which staves were soaked. The building is described in the book as the Watch House, where materials in and out of the site were monitored. It might also have been used as a store.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Small, rectangular, single-storey shed, in line with the track over the brook to the South Chimney. Aligned north to south. South gable end mostly survives. The west wall stands to full height; the east wall survives only as footings. No doors or windows are present in the three standing walls. There is plaster rendering on the interior. Small stone-lined channel runs east to west down the outside of, and parallel to, the south wall.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Incorporating/composition mill (south), possible cartridge press house (south of N building) and possible corning/dusting house/glazing mill. Consists of two pairs of structures on either side of two wheelpits. The tailrace of the southern wheepit discharges back to the Cherrybrook. The wheel between the southern mill was powered by a continuation of the leat powering buildings to the north. The wheelpit tailrace discharged via a channel into Cherry Brook. The culvert has an arched roof of granite blocks overlain by slabs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Similar in plan to &amp;lsquo;Buildings 1 and 2&amp;rsquo;, consisting of two units flanking a central wheelpit. The wheelpit is largely filled with rubble. The wheel was powered by water from the tailrace of the wheelpit of &amp;lsquo;Building 2&amp;rsquo;. The three incorporating mill houses (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) were of massive construction with many granite blocks being 6-feet long and the was about 6-feet thick, to withstand inadvertent explosions. The roofs were very flimsy, of wood and tar, to blow off without damaging the main structure. They could be replaced easily.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background: 5 (1) Incorporating Mill:&lt;/strong> Consists of a pair of gable-ended structures flanking a large central wheelpit. Both of massive granite blocks with walls about 2 metres thick at their bases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tar dribbles indicate original roofing was of tarred tarpaulin or wood. This was probably to allow any accidental explosion to go upwards and leave the walls standing, a technique still used by artisinal powder makers in India and China today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wheelpit is aligned north-east to south-west and runs the whole width of the units. Wheel axle appears to have projected into their ground floors. Powered by a launder to the north-east which flowed out through a culvert to the south-west. This is roofed for 3.5 - 4 metres, then becomes an open channel which runs downhill to feed the reservoir belonging to &amp;lsquo;Building 2&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The raised bank at the left brought the leat that fed a launder to the waterwheel.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This proving mortar is just off the road, on the left, on the last bend when driving in approaching the Pottery, cafe and mill cottages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It fired a (probably) 68 lb ball to test the powder. The distance travelled by the ball was a measure of the strength of the powder and undoubtedly a good sales tactic for potential buyers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This walk was reached from a small roadside layby marked by the yellow cross below the &amp;ldquo;Lich Way Plaque&amp;rdquo; label on the map. Normally, for a group, it would be reached from the main car park in Postbridge or the car park in the forest just across the road from it. There is also a car park at Higher Cherry Brook Bridge, marked with the P symbol and yellow cross on the map&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Please note that there is no parking available at the Powdermills Pottery and shop except when visiting them&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Norsworthy Bridge, Devonport Leat</title><link>https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/norsworthy-bridge-devonport-leat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/norsworthy-bridge-devonport-leat/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/norsworthy-bridge-devonport-leat/1.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Norsworthy Bridge, Devonport Leat" />&lt;h2 id="information">Information

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A short and interesting walk with many historic points of interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting at the Norsworthy Bridge car part, we climb established tracks taking in many points of interest along the way. These include old tinner&amp;rsquo;s stones, several artificial caves, a longhouse, a ruined tin mill, the Devonport leat, wheel pits and an abandoned tare and feathers still wedged in the rock.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Note the granite slabs forming the roof, making this a man-made cave (for tools) rather than the more usual potato cave. Potato caves are normally dug into growan (&amp;ldquo;rotted&amp;rdquo; granite). In this photograph, there is water in the fougou. The dimensions are 11-feet deep, 3-feet wide, 4-feet high, with the entrance being just 2-feet high (Hemery, High Dartmoor, p.124). There is a traditional potato cave just 50 metres away on the track below Leathertor Farm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Leathertor Farm is first recorded in Bailiff&amp;rsquo;s Accounts for the Manor of Dartmoor in 1362, regarding the renting of land at Leddertorre. Later, in 1511, more detailed reports were made. The last tenant was William Lillicrap who abandoned the farm in 1924. Some occupants were also tinners.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am inclined to disagree and suggest this is the base for a large, mounted sharpening stone, the bottom of which could run through water in the trough, making it a wet stone (not to be confused with whet, an old word that means to &amp;ldquo;sharpen&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have provided the horse-power for a similar stone - but with an iron strap frame and without the trough, when my father wanted to sharpen his axe - around 1956-1964!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Walkhampton Parish Council decided on 20th June 1833 to build a bridge over Riddipit Stream (nowadays, the River Meavy) at this spot (this is the site of the Riddipit Steps stepping stones crossing place).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the next meeting the following month (25th July) it was resolved to accept a tender from George Worth and Wm. Mashford for £26.10s. This is a little more elaborate than most clapper bridges in that it has parapets.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;p>Hemery (p.127) notes alternative names are Ritthy Pit, Riddy Pit, Reedapit (1611), possibly to do with rushes, rishes or reeds. There were two houses here, shown on the 1840 tithe map - the remains of one longhouse are seen at the right edge of this photograph and the second one is seen across the clearing, down by the track. There are other ruined buildings, possibly barns, animal sheds or labourers&amp;rsquo; dwellings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Riddipit Stream rises above the site and crosses the track in a granite conduit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crossing&amp;rsquo;s Guide, p.100: Riddy Pit, there are stones with hollows in them (i.e. mortar stones), now in the paving of the track, a little beyond this view up the track. Close by, is an old wall, in the nearby hedge is a stone with a cavity on each side. Another curious stone with a round top and a piece of iron leaded into it is probably the upper stone of a crushing mill: this was never found by Hemery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First recorded 1564, abandoned by 1871 when the enclosures were incorporated into Leather Tor Farm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Described as a blowing house, but with no trace of a leat, launder bank or wheel pit, three necessary signs for a blowing house or tin mill, therefore probably a cart shed for the farm (Hemery p.128).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the field behind this hedge is called &amp;ldquo;Mill Park&amp;rdquo; in the tithe apportionments (Plot 930).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, the remains an old mortar stone is to be found here under the leaves and debris - but mortar stones are found widespread in the area.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>RN Worth (1967) Worth&amp;rsquo;s Dartmoor, David &amp;amp; Charles, page 417, describes it as a potato cave (always dug into growan) but Eric Hemery (1983) High Dartmoor, Robert Hale, London, page 129, argues that it shows signs of corbelling (as used in beehive huts, never seen in potato caves) and is in fact a cache (or vooga / fougou) for miners&amp;rsquo; tools from the Keaglesborough (Kekelles Burrowghe) Tin Mine.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="keaglesborough-mine">Keaglesborough Mine
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The earliest reference to tinworking on this site is in a deed from 1538, where it is called Kekylsburgh. There is also a mention in a Walkhampton Manor court roll dated 1565 of Kekellas Burrowghe Mill. There are other references in deeds etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keaglesburrowe Sett, &amp;ldquo;Keagles Burro also Lambards Park&amp;rdquo; (1748-65) and again (1811-20), another mention in 1820 uses &amp;ldquo;Lambers Parks Alies Kegales Borough&amp;rdquo; (= alias) and later Keagles Burrow Mine. Source: Mike Brown (2001) Guide to Dartmoor, CD-ROM, Dartmoor Press, Grid Square 573 701.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tin mining started with men following alluvial deposits up streams and rivers and then digging into veins/lodes with pits and openworks (gerts or beams) into the hills. An Openwork in the nearby Newleycombe valley (Kingsett Gert) was first mentioned in 1505 (then, a long time in dispute), with a later date of 1639 (i.e. more than 140 years working). Ref. Phil Newman (1998), The Dartmoor Tin Industry - A Field Guide, Chercombe Press, Newton Abbot, p.8.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Early tin workings, while being a large industry in medieval times, finally ceased production by 1750 (Newman, Ibid, p.55).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the late 1700s and 1800s, workings started going underground - with drainage effected by adits, horizontal tunnels driven into hillsides to let water run out of the workings e.g. Keaglesborough and Eylesborough.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tinning was important on Dartmoor from about 1150 and throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;br>
Stannary records show that in the busiest period, 1515-1538, the &amp;ldquo;average&amp;rdquo; output of white tin metal presented annually for coinage was about 500,000 lbs i.e. 223 tons.
Thus, over this 24 years, this would have been 5,357 tons. If a mould stone produced ingots that weighed about 1 cwt then this means 107,143 ingots were produced.
It is believed that not all tin was presented for coinage and taxation.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="twist-farm">Twist Farm
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Shown as &amp;ldquo;Twist&amp;rdquo; on the OS Map, but also locally known as Twyste farm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twist was mentioned in thge Domesday Book on 1086, and the owners had Venville rights, allowing them to take what they needed from the moor. Grazing, stone, peat - but not green oak or venison.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The farm was abandoned somewhere in the middle of the 1900s - the kitchen range and abandoned vehicles date from the 30&amp;rsquo;s onwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twist was put up for sale in 1934 and likely fell into dereliction relatively soon afterwards, perhaps during the second world war which drained many young men from the country.&lt;/p>
