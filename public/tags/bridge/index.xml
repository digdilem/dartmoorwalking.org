&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This fairly gentle walk has plenty to see along the way. We start with a walk across flattish open moorland to three seats with good views. Then we cross over the River Lyd by footbridge and walk down to the ruined Doe Tor Farmstead. Leaving there, we can return up the river, or detour across the Lyd by stepping stones to the abandoned 19th Century mine, Wheal Mary Emma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Once parked, head off due East along a worn path for around 350 meters until you see a bench to the left.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Arms Tor (SX 541 862, elevation 457 metres / 1499 feet) with a small &amp;ldquo;pimple&amp;rdquo; to the right of the summit - marked by the &amp;ldquo;v&amp;rdquo; - which is a part of Great Links Tor. (See next picture)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brat Tor (SX 539 855, elevation 452 metres /1482 feet) (Also known as Brai, Bra or Bray Tor)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Widgery Cross was erected by the painter William Widgery (1822-1893) to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cross is constructed from 10 courses of granite blocks, capped with a rough slab, reaching 13feet in height.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The words &amp;ldquo;W. Widgery, Fecit, Jubilee VR&amp;rdquo; are inscribed on the eastern side of the base stone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These walls are said to be a large building, although its use is unknown. It might be associated with the Wheal Mary Emma tin mine downstream, but if so, it&amp;rsquo;s an unusual structure for a mining building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It does not appear in the tithe map of 1848, nor the OS 25-inch map from 1884, but does show up on the revised 1904 version. The mine was active in the 1860s so the timings are not far out if it was related.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, it could be a farming or warren enclosure rather than a building.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Doe Tor Farm is a post-medieval farmstead dating to the mid 18th century and was abandoned around 1955 as uneconomic or uninhabitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A perfect prehistoric flint scraper was found here in 2001 proving man&amp;rsquo;s presence here around 4,000 to 5,000 years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The MOD commissioned an extensive site survey report which is linked below. It&amp;rsquo;s very recommended to read as it includes a lot of well written information and interpretation, including human interest from the people who farmed here.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When you leave the farm and cross over Doe Tor Bridge, you can either return back up the river to High Down Ford and, after crossing the Lyd, follow the hedge back to the car park taking in the mining site of Wheal Mary Emma tin mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, if the weather is kind and the water level is low you may wish to brave a river crossing by some stepping stones. This path is marked in purple on the map and the rest of the description here follows that trail.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wheel Mary Emma was a tin mine built on the River Lyd some time between 1849 and 1900. The larger ruined stone building was likely a blowing house for producing tin ingots from the crushed ore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is still evidence of a banked-up track above the flatter dressing floors, with two round buddles. Next to these is a filled in wheelpit where water from the Lyd was diverted to drive a 30-40 foot water wheel, providing power to the whole mine site for pumping, ventilation and even driving the buddles. A stone-lined tunnel runs from the bottom of the wheelpit to the river bank below the scarp to let water drain back once it had done its job of turning the wheel. There was at least one shaft dug to extract tin on this site.&lt;/p>

>Woodland Trust&lt;/a>, Pullabrook Woods is a lovely little area popular with dog walkers. There are woodland paths up the west side of the River Bovey, crossing it at a notable stone bridge, and back down the Eastern side, re-crossing close to the car park. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly lovely on a hot summer&amp;rsquo;s day as most is well shaded. The area is known for its wildlife, especially wild birds - with the rare Dartford Warbler, the Kingfisher and Pied Flycatcher seen here. There are also dormice, otter and bats with the river home to Salmon and Brown and Sea Trout.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="pullabrook-woods">Pullabrook Woods
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Also known as &amp;ldquo;Pullbrook Woods&amp;rdquo;, if only by Ordance Survey, these woodlands are 50 acres (20ha) in size and are a mix of ancient woodland and wildflower-rich wet meadows in the steep-sided valley of the River Bovey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name Pullabrook probably comes from the personal name, &amp;ldquo;Polla&amp;rdquo;, so in modern terms, &amp;ldquo;Polla&amp;rsquo;s Brook&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nearby Pullabrook Farm is mentioned in the Domesday book of 1086 where it is written as &amp;ldquo;Polebroc&amp;rdquo; and was seized by William the Conquerer as part of the Bovi estate when the Normans invaded. As a reward for his support, William gave this estate to Geoffrey de Mowbray the Bishop of Coutances. The current farmhouse dates from the sixteenth century and is Grade II listed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We briefly leave The Woodland&amp;rsquo;s Trust land and enter the bottom edge of Trendlebere Down, owned by English Heritage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This unsealed track is, in fact, a fully legal road and you may see cars and motorbikes using it as well as cyclists, horseriders and walkers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the road that travels above us on Trendlebere Down was built in the 19th Century, this was the original and main road between Bovey Tracey and Manaton.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s now a Byway Open to All Traffic (BOAT) which means any road going vehicle can legally use it provided they are taxed and insured - although much of it is only suitable to off road vehicles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The name &amp;ldquo;Pudding Stone&amp;rdquo; describe several types of rock around the world. In this case, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that this is just a natural lumps of granite that happens to resemble a pudding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you look closely, you will see that it has a inscribed feature of an arrow and line. This is a benchmark, likely carved during the 1800s when the Ordnance Survey did detailed mapping of the UK. There are over half a million of these symbols, some dating back to 1831, which provide a fixed point of reference. They are no longer created as technology has made them obsolete, but still a good reminder of how we created the most accurate maps in the world by measuring angles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hisley Bridge is a post-medieval bridge built some time between 1401 and 1750 to improve safe access over the river for pack horses when the river is in spate, making the ford difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pillar in the middle of the bridge is a modern addition to prevent off road vehicles from using the bridge, which had already caused damage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The viaduct once carried the GWR Moretonhampstead Railway Branch Line. This opened in 1866 as an independent line, and amalgamated with the GWR ten years later. British Rail nationalised it in 1948 and it closed in 1964 - another victim of Dr Beeching&amp;rsquo;s cuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part of this line remains from Newton Abbot to Heathfield, although it has not been used for several years. It was resurrected briefly in the 2000&amp;rsquo;s to take away timber from Teign Grace halt but has since been idle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see more evidence of the railway in many places from Newton Abbot to Moretonhampstead - such as the railway sheds at Bovey Tracey, many viaducts such as this, and some engine sheds at the Thompson&amp;rsquo;s lorry yard where it terminated. Much of the route is now a shared-use path for walkers, cyclists and horseriders.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a pleasant walk up a historic valley with plenty to see along the way. I&amp;rsquo;ve included a possible detour if you wanted to extend the walk to include Swincombe Intake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much of this land is owned by Anton Coaker who lives at Sherberton Farm who farms the distinctive red Galloway cattle and Dartmoor ponies on this land.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Coaker&amp;rsquo;s dedication to breeding good quality Dartmoor Ponies is well known and is several generations long. I recall visiting his mother, Diane Coaker, at Sherberton farm to view some of her ponies with my own mother in the 1980s. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Anton himself is very well known as the author of several books, newspaper articles and is a very knowledgeable and erudite writer on Moorland and Hill Farming matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.anton-coaker.co.uk/our-farm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Anton Coaker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Our Farm&amp;rdquo; website&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Start the walk by proceeding back 140 meters along the road you approached the parking along, then turn right at the end of the wall along a Bridlepath&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dartmoor has had many fine dry stone wall builders, but perhaps the most famous of all was John Bishop (1821-1892). He was one of the first to use the shaped and squared building method in his walls. He tightly fitted large blocks of granite in such a way that very little daylight could be seen through the wall. He helped enclose many of the newtakes on Dartmoor and would have been in strong demand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When asked how he lifted such heavy stones, John Bishop is alleged to have replied, “Aw, ‘tis surprisin’ what ee can do with a laiver or two.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of the walls in this area were built or repaired by Mr Bishop who lived close by - we&amp;rsquo;ll visit his house on this walk - and are of a visibly better quality than most earlier walls, which were mostly built from natural moorstone, using &amp;ldquo;trigs&amp;rdquo; of small stone to wedge them in place. But no matter how well a dry stone wall is made, it needs repairing often due to weather and especially animals and people climbing it and loosening stone, so other men will have been involved over the years in keeping these walls stockproof.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dolly Trebble was a particularly attractive girl who caught the eye of many men of Dartmoor in the 18th Century. Despite being married to William Trebble, she was courted by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt (1762-1833) - an important man who shaped much of Princetown and Dartmoor, and no less than George IV, the Prince Regent who visited here several times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She was written about by Sabine Baring Gould and Dolly was clearly a woman of some fame. Tim Sandles has an entertaining version of Dolly&amp;rsquo;s story on his Legendary Dartmoor site if you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>When ready, proceed down to join the moor road to the west and walk a short way to the bridge over the river Swincombe, where you have a choice&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="detour-to-swincombe-intake">Detour to Swincombe Intake
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Possible detour (An extra mile and a half)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you continue walking along this road to the west, after around 1.2km you&amp;rsquo;ll come to the Swincombe Intake. This is a small reservoir and unusual art-deco building that collects water which is piped to Venford Reservoir to help fill it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Swincombe Intake Reservoir was built between 1929 and 1933 by Paignton Urban District Council Waterworks Department. A particularly ugly building with the exception of an art deco motif over the modern door, as befitting its construction date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If you took this detour, head back to the same point at the Fairy bridge when you are ready to return&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-flooding-of-swincombe-valley">The flooding of Swincombe Valley
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This valley starts up at Peat Cott with the infamous Foxtor Mire at its head, which acts as a huge sponge providing a steady flow throughout even the driest of summers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was that which prompted a plan in the 1960s to flood this entire valley to provide another reservoir on Dartmoor, far larger than the modest intake that has stood there for a hundred years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not surprisingly, this caused a lot of opposition. Perhaps the most vocal opponent was Lady Sylvia Sayer who, with the Dartmoor Preservation Association, resisted this at every turn. You will by now have noticed that you&amp;rsquo;re not under several meters of water, so it should be no surprise to learn that in 1970, the opposers won and permission was refused. Planning was retried several times through the 70s and 80s until in 1985, the DPA used funds from a bequest to acquire 50 acres of this valley to protect it.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Left and right of the path just before we leave this road, is the site of Gobbett Tin Mine. There are remnants of this work still visible, as well as the very obvious tunnel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mine ran from 1836 to 1874 but did not produce large yields.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ore from the adit would be smashed down small enough to fit into the top hole of this stone which sat above the base stone. The top stone was then rotated, possibly by pony or donkey or water power, to grind the ore just as grain is turned into wheat. The resulting fine sand was then smelted to form ingots.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once smelted and the impurities floated off, the near-pure tin was poured into a mould stone to form a 200lb ingot. This was a standard weight for transporting by pony off the moor.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The chemical symbol for Tin is &amp;ldquo;Sn&amp;rdquo; which stands for stannous or stannic. From this comes the Latin for Tin, Stannum. From that, comes Stannator (Stannary parliament), stannary laws, stannary towns etc.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>When the Swincombe Intake was built in the 1920s, the builders needed to run a pipe from there to the Venford Reservoir some 6 kilometers away. They opted to reuse and extend this adit to run that pipe through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tunnel continues through the hill in a straight line for 540 meters, emerging in a field 150m North West of The Forest Inn.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The staining on the ground by metalliferous leaching indicates that there are metal ores in this vicinity. This particular mine was dug for Tin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adits are horizontal tunnels used in mining. Some are used for access in and out and some are used for draining upper levels of water. This one is only open for about 10 meters, and was worked in tandem with the shafts on the slope immediately above it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There would have been a spoil heap here when they were dug, but that has been removed by later activity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is one of two wheelpits found here and is the earliest, showing on the 1841 Tithe Map. A large waterwheel once ran here and was to drive a series of flat-rods back and forth motion which carried the power to the nearby quarry where it powered pumps to keep the water free of water, which at its end reached a depth of 130 feet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a second wheelpit just upstream but it is known that both were not used together. They ceased operation by 1905.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wheels were fed by a reservoir above and a wooden launder (a basic 3-sided chute to run water down) and were of &amp;ldquo;pitch back&amp;rdquo; design, where water was added to the top of the wheel so that it filled buckets and drove the wheel back towards the wooden launder that supplied water. It was found that one reservoir didn&amp;rsquo;t supply enough water as the needs of the quarry grew and a second was added to increase flow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This second wheelpit housed a water wheel some 18 foot in diameter. The walls are better preserved than the first but quite overgrown. Behind it, there is a depression which is a &amp;ldquo;bob-pit&amp;rdquo;. This housed a large counter-weight which kept tension on the flat-rods as they worked to operate the quarry pumps.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Meldon Viaduct was built in 1874 by William Galbraith from wrought iron for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to connect Okehampton to Lydford and then on to Plymouth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was widened to double-track in 1879 by building a second viaduct alongside, this one of steel, and joining the two. This was in service until 1968 when it became yet another victim of the Beeching Cuts. Meldon Quarry continued to use it up until the 1980s for shunting its trains until the track was removed in 1990.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s now used by &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Granite_Way" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Granite Way&lt;/a> - a shared-use foot, cycle and bridlepath and is a scheduled monument.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These are some of the quarry&amp;rsquo;s waste dumps, more properly named as &amp;ldquo;finger dumps&amp;rdquo; for their shape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the late 1800s the &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo; was taken in trucks to a series of corrugated iron buildings at the northern end of the east side tramway. A transfer shed was used where the finished material was consigned to wagons operating on an incline leading to the London and South Western Rail sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct. This incline becomes apparent as an earthwork partially obscuring the mouth of the early lime kiln. The crushed stone was used as ballast on railways and roads across the country and any unsuitable stone ended up here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This old limestone quarry, now flooded. It was used to dig a special Carbonifereous period limestone, not found anywhere else on Dartmoor, and much prized for producing lime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pool is about 130 feet deep, and when worked was kept drained by pumps driven by the water wheels earlier on our walk. This makes it deeper than the viaduct is high, that being a mere 120 foot tall at its highest span.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hundred years ago this site will have been very noisy and busy, with explosions and cranes operating, horse drawn carts rumbling around and men shouting. There will also have been rock crushers and stamps running within earshot, as well as steam trains going over the railway.&lt;/p>

data-flex-grow="177"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lime kiln was built between 1880 and 1885.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lime was made in the kiln by setting alternating layers of limestone and charcoal made from coppiced hazel trees. Once the kiln was filled to the brim, the fire was lit and everything burned at a high temperature for three days, leaving behind quicklime, Calcium Oxide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slaked lime can be made, carefully, from lime by adding water. This process is called hydration and as the reaction is exothermic, a huge amount of heat is produced and this can be extremely dangerous. Quicklime was so named from the old word &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo;, as it acted like it was alive when water was added as it churned and boiled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once made, quick and slaked lime have many uses:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Agriculture&lt;/strong>: Increases the PH level of fields by being spread in powder form, transforming acidic soils into sweeter and more productive ground.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Construction&lt;/strong>: Lime Mortar has long been used for building, and is favoured even today for stone buildings instead of cement mortars, as it can move and even heal small cracks as it absorbs moisture. It&amp;rsquo;s also used as limewash for painting, and lime render to cover and stabilise walls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Manufacturing&lt;/strong>: Lime is used for all sorts of things, including paper, steel, sugar, paint and other processes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Medicine&lt;/strong>: In the right conditions, lime is also a disinfectant, and is used in purification methods.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Water was piped from the Red-a-ven brook to a turbine housed in this building, generating power for the quarry. Spent water was then released into a short brick-lined channel on the West side of the building to return to the brook.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Somewhere near to the turbine house there were once corrugated iron buildings that housed crushers. These worked previous spoil heaps, crushing limestone which was then loaded onto wagons on an incline that led to the railway sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This stone ruin was once where explosives for the quarry were kept. Before each shift, the explosives handler would take only enough from here for that shift&amp;rsquo;s operation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such handlers were often selected from the most careful and thorough of the workers, and would avoid carrying any iron tools, or even removed iron hobnails from their boots to reduce the chance of sparks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although the walls are strong, explosives stores often had very weak roofs - typically made of stick and oilcloth. If there was an accident, then the force would be sent upwards instead of outwards and repairs to the building would therefore be relatively quick.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These modern buildings are associated with more recent quarrying after 1921. The site remained open for a further fifty years until around 1970 and provided stone for road metalling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before these buildings, there was a failed glass bottle operation on this site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the late 19th century, investigations were being made concerning the production of granulite (a granular metamorphic rock) at Meldon. There seemed to be potential to establish both glass and china works at the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was little activity until 1920 when a syndicate from London decided to build a glass factory. Two furnaces were installed out of a planned 12, and about 500 men were required. However, by February 1921, the men had been laid off and new owners were being sought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No obvious features remain of a glass industry, but large amounts of broken glass fragments can be seen, mostly representing small medicine and cosmetic bottles. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; (Western Morning News 29/03/1920&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>
