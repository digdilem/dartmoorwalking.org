&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is an interesting walk over open moorland taking in a wide scope of history, from Bronze age and medieval remains, to an abandoned Victorian railway, and disused granite quarries - all with excellent views over Dartmoor and West Devon into Cornwall. There&amp;rsquo;s a small detour offered which takes in an abandoned Medieval Longhouse, its modern replacement and two ancient Pounds and hut circles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Reaves - land boundaries of heaped stones&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are essentially four types of reaves:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Field boundaries to divide land into normally long strip-like fields for grazing or growing crops, akin to modern walls or hedges.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Terminal reaves that are uphill from field boundaries that marked lower divided areas from uphill open or &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; land&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reaves built usually along ridges to mark watersheds i.e. between river valleys&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Long divisions over kilometres marking out territories akin to parishes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The Walkhampton Common Reave is 3170 meters long and mostly straight. It was built in the Bronze Age (Between 4000 BC and 1000 BC), and forms a division between the Walkham and Meavy valleys, thus identifying it as a Reave of type 3 in the above list - built to separate two watersheds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The modern mast of North Hessary Tor transmitting station can be seen in the background. This was built in 1955 to supply 405-line television to Devon and is 196 meters (643 feet) tall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, it provides analogue FM radio covering a large area, including Devon, Cornwall, Somerset and South Wales.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, it provides Digital DAB radio and DVB-T television - and is a useful landmark to identify where Princetown is.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Heading Northwest from Leeden Tor, we very soon cross another reave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Great Western Reave measures over 10 kilometres in length and is the longest known prehistoric land division boundary on Dartmoor. This record covers the most southerly section of the reave (two sections measuring a combined length of 2.58 kilometres). Along its length, the width of the reave varies between 2.5 metres and 4 metres, whilst its height varies between 0.2 metres and 0.7 metres - although it would have been higher when built. A second reave leads off at right angles at SX5577 7088 and there are hut circles and cairns associated with the reave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This very long reave is a territorial boundary something akin to a modern parish boundary (and type 4 from the list above) It extends from near Sharpitor, near Dousland/Yelverton, to White Tor near Peter Tavy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This cist is described by Jeremy Butler, 1994, Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 3 - The South-West, 16: Ingra Tor cairn and cist (fig. 45.13), page 51.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The cist is a few metres above the Routrundle leat, which is about 23 metres down the slope. The leat is marked by a downhill bank but is really quite non-photogenic and it is not easy to see the actual &amp;ldquo;trench&amp;rdquo; that was the water course in photographs, so it is not included here.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stone pits are generally places where walling or building stone was easily won from the ground because of natural fissures or weathering. Sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re mistaken for tinning holes where the old men would find small deposits of cassiterite - a rich source of tin ore. Those would usually have some spoil heaps nearby though, which aren&amp;rsquo;t evident here, so stone pits seems likely. The only two certain things about these holes however, is that they are impossible to date, and that they were made by man.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ingra Tor Quarry, like the nearby Swell Tor, King&amp;rsquo;s Tor and Foggintor Quarries, were run by the Johnson Brothers from 1820 to 1865 who paid a lease to the Duchy of Cornwall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was re-opened between 1936 and 1941 to cut kerbstones and granite setts for Devon County Council, and a platform was built on the railway called Ingra Tor Halt, just to the North of the Tor.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>This once held a small shelter from the elements, built partly inside a pound.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There was a short wooden platform to the single track railway.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At the time of opening in 1936, a single fare from here to Princetown was 11 1/2d First Class, or 7d Second Class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The halt was built for quarry workers, but when the quarries closed, was used exclusively by walkers, most coming up from Plymouth. Walking from here to Princetown and then riding back home was a popular route before the railway closed on March 3, 1956.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There was a famous sign here advising passengers to keep dogs on a lead due to the presence of adders. This sign is now kept at Buckfastleigh Station.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This bridge was built to provide safe passage for cattle and other livestock to cross the railway. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that the railway was fenced with posts and wire to keep stock off the line, so creeps like this were essential to allow free grazing under commoners rights.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This curious set of holes shows that this block was once used for a tramway in one of the nearby quarries. These holes held an iron plate which held the iron rails above it. Wear from those rails can be seen above and below. No longer of use there, it was re-used in constructing this creep.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This area of Dartmoor has been inhabited for at least four thousand years.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The earliest remains are the large circular pounds and nicely viewable via the aerial view below. This, together with the hut circles nearby, formed an early settlement around 4000 to 1000 BC and provide evidence of animal husbandry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To the Northwest are the stone ruins of a Medieval Longhouse, Smithy and other buildings built between 1066 and 1539.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Routrundle is the &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; farmhouse dating from a mere 1866, currently inhabited. Build after and probably to replace Babyland Longhouse. There are claims this house dates back to 1417, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible that is confused with the Babyland property.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Routrundle is no longer a working farm. It fell into disrepair and was left vacant after a Jim Fence left.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Routrundle&amp;rdquo; is named after the Bronze Age &amp;ldquo;trundles&amp;rdquo; or pounds still so visible today.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://media.onthemarket.com/properties/3992108/doc_0_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stags sales particulars (2018)&lt;/a> give a good view of the property, inside and out. It sold for £618,000 in 2018.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(Not pictured) There is a benchmark on the southwest side of the lane on a large boulder. SX55274 71832&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The collection of trees in the above photo marks a Bronze Age pound and collection of hut circles. These can be accessed from a Bridlepath off the railway a little further on, along with a Medieval Longhouse marked on the map as &amp;ldquo;homestead&amp;rdquo; a little way North of . This was called Babyland. This is a long-inhabited area of Dartmoor.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is one of my favourite walks and is never busy, despite being so close to Haytor Rock. Most people seem to overlook Haytor Down in their eagerness to get into other parts of the moor but there is much to appreciate here, from stunning views over Teignmouth&amp;rsquo;s coastline, to an abandoned quarry, the stover granite tramway and a lovely stretch of ancient woodland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This walk can be done in either direction, but anti-clockwise is advised, as you can then appreciate the views full as you walk down the Granite Tramway.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geocaching">Geocaching
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.geocaching.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Geocaching&lt;/a> is a game of finding hidden containers using a GPS or Smart Phone. The containers have a small paper log which you sign to prove you were there, and a website where you log your find. Basic membership is free. If this sounds a lot like Letterboxing, that&amp;rsquo;s because it is based on it, but brought up to date. Many Dartmoor walkers and Letterboxers also geocache as they go hand in hand, and Geocaches are a good way to find interesting places to explore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a series of Geocaches that follow this walk (that&amp;rsquo;s why I know this area, I set these caches and walk this route to maintain them once or twice a year!) If that sounds interesting, pop over to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC4VD4J" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>We follow this old tramway for about a mile downhill&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This tramway was built on the instruction of George Templer (1781-1843), a family that also built the main Haytor Quarries, the Stover Canal and Stover House in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The gauge of this tramway is 4'3&amp;quot; and it&amp;rsquo;s taken from granite cut and shaped at the Haytor quarries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are sets of points further up the tramway where the trams could be steered into different quarries or sidings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Granite cut from Haytor or Holwell Quarries was loaded onto strong wooden trucks (See picture below)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Tramway runs down from Haytor Rocks to Stover Canal, where the granite would be transferred to sailing barges to take it to Teignmouth docks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Around 12 of these trucks were connected together in a &amp;ldquo;train&amp;rdquo; with the iron wheels sitting in the flat sections.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A team of around 18 horses was then connected in single file to one end of the train. If it was loaded and heading downhill, the horses would be fixed to the last truck to provide braking. If they were pulling the trucks back up from Stover, they would be hitched to the front to better pull.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tramway is intact for much of its original course, down through Yarner Woods, past Bovey and on to Stover.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The sound of running water will alert you to this large collector tank above the path - it always seems to be overflowing even in the driest summer, and runs across the path here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The water is fed into this tank from a blue alkathene pipe, which continues up the hill over loose waste rock. If you follow it, it actually enters a gated Adit which is always dripping and provides a clearly sufficient flow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are actually two adits here, about a hundred meters apart on the same level, both with small fences and gates, and usually padlocked.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These adits don&amp;rsquo;t go far in, and side trials are short. The waste rock outside has a red tinge which indicates iron, so it&amp;rsquo;s likely that&amp;rsquo;s what was being searched for.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The actual adit area is quite overgrown now, but worth a detour if you like adits and don&amp;rsquo;t mind a bit of a scramble through undergrowth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You may spot some rooftops downhill as you&amp;rsquo;re walking along. These belong to Yarner House. This is a Grade II Listed Tudor house dating back to the 1600s and has been renovated to a luxurious standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Yarner House estate is 247 acres.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It was part of the Manor of Bovey Tracey which William the Conqueror (Norman invader of 1066, also known as William the Bastard) siezed and then granted to Geoffrey de Mowbray, Bishop of Coutances.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On de Mowbray’s death in 1093, his nephew, Robert Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, inherited, but later defied the king, which led to the seizure of his estates in 1095.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eventually, ownership of the Bovey Tracey estates reverted to the Crown until, in the 16th century, a succession of costly wars left Tudor monarchs strapped for cash.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Elizabeth I began to sell off Crown properties and, in 1578, the Yarner estate was bought by Gregory Sprint, a canny lawyer with good Court connections, who swiftly resold it at a profit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The estate includes Yarner Woods, which is managed by Natural England and has several miles of woodland paths open to the public.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are copper mines in Yarner woods which, combined with other mines and quarries contributed to the wealth of the estate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Today, it is a Hotel that offers Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Adits are horizontal tunnels used in mining. Some are used for access in and out and some are used for draining upper levels of water. This one is only open for about 10 meters, and was worked in tandem with the shafts on the slope immediately above it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There would have been a spoil heap here when they were dug, but that has been removed by later activity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is one of two wheelpits found here and is the earliest, showing on the 1841 Tithe Map. A large waterwheel once ran here and was to drive a series of flat-rods back and forth motion which carried the power to the nearby quarry where it powered pumps to keep the water free of water, which at its end reached a depth of 130 feet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a second wheelpit just upstream but it is known that both were not used together. They ceased operation by 1905.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wheels were fed by a reservoir above and a wooden launder (a basic 3-sided chute to run water down) and were of &amp;ldquo;pitch back&amp;rdquo; design, where water was added to the top of the wheel so that it filled buckets and drove the wheel back towards the wooden launder that supplied water. It was found that one reservoir didn&amp;rsquo;t supply enough water as the needs of the quarry grew and a second was added to increase flow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Meldon Viaduct was built in 1874 by William Galbraith from wrought iron for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to connect Okehampton to Lydford and then on to Plymouth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was widened to double-track in 1879 by building a second viaduct alongside, this one of steel, and joining the two. This was in service until 1968 when it became yet another victim of the Beeching Cuts. Meldon Quarry continued to use it up until the 1980s for shunting its trains until the track was removed in 1990.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s now used by &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Granite_Way" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Granite Way&lt;/a> - a shared-use foot, cycle and bridlepath and is a scheduled monument.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These are some of the quarry&amp;rsquo;s waste dumps, more properly named as &amp;ldquo;finger dumps&amp;rdquo; for their shape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the late 1800s the &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo; was taken in trucks to a series of corrugated iron buildings at the northern end of the east side tramway. A transfer shed was used where the finished material was consigned to wagons operating on an incline leading to the London and South Western Rail sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct. This incline becomes apparent as an earthwork partially obscuring the mouth of the early lime kiln. The crushed stone was used as ballast on railways and roads across the country and any unsuitable stone ended up here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This old limestone quarry, now flooded. It was used to dig a special Carbonifereous period limestone, not found anywhere else on Dartmoor, and much prized for producing lime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pool is about 130 feet deep, and when worked was kept drained by pumps driven by the water wheels earlier on our walk. This makes it deeper than the viaduct is high, that being a mere 120 foot tall at its highest span.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hundred years ago this site will have been very noisy and busy, with explosions and cranes operating, horse drawn carts rumbling around and men shouting. There will also have been rock crushers and stamps running within earshot, as well as steam trains going over the railway.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lime kiln was built between 1880 and 1885.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lime was made in the kiln by setting alternating layers of limestone and charcoal made from coppiced hazel trees. Once the kiln was filled to the brim, the fire was lit and everything burned at a high temperature for three days, leaving behind quicklime, Calcium Oxide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slaked lime can be made, carefully, from lime by adding water. This process is called hydration and as the reaction is exothermic, a huge amount of heat is produced and this can be extremely dangerous. Quicklime was so named from the old word &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo;, as it acted like it was alive when water was added as it churned and boiled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once made, quick and slaked lime have many uses:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Agriculture&lt;/strong>: Increases the PH level of fields by being spread in powder form, transforming acidic soils into sweeter and more productive ground.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Construction&lt;/strong>: Lime Mortar has long been used for building, and is favoured even today for stone buildings instead of cement mortars, as it can move and even heal small cracks as it absorbs moisture. It&amp;rsquo;s also used as limewash for painting, and lime render to cover and stabilise walls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Manufacturing&lt;/strong>: Lime is used for all sorts of things, including paper, steel, sugar, paint and other processes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Medicine&lt;/strong>: In the right conditions, lime is also a disinfectant, and is used in purification methods.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This stone ruin was once where explosives for the quarry were kept. Before each shift, the explosives handler would take only enough from here for that shift&amp;rsquo;s operation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although the walls are strong, explosives stores often had very weak roofs - typically made of stick and oilcloth. If there was an accident, then the force would be sent upwards instead of outwards and repairs to the building would therefore be relatively quick.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These modern buildings are associated with more recent quarrying after 1921. The site remained open for a further fifty years until around 1970 and provided stone for road metalling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before these buildings, there was a failed glass bottle operation on this site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the late 19th century, investigations were being made concerning the production of granulite (a granular metamorphic rock) at Meldon. There seemed to be potential to establish both glass and china works at the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was little activity until 1920 when a syndicate from London decided to build a glass factory. Two furnaces were installed out of a planned 12, and about 500 men were required. However, by February 1921, the men had been laid off and new owners were being sought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No obvious features remain of a glass industry, but large amounts of broken glass fragments can be seen, mostly representing small medicine and cosmetic bottles. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; (Western Morning News 29/03/1920&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Meldon Dam was begun in 1970 and completed in 1974, making it the newest of Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s large dams.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is 55 meters (180 feet) high.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s 200 meters (660 feet) wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The reservoir is stocked with Brown Trout for licenced angling.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uniquely, Meldon reservoir became the first water-supply body to produce electricity when a 500kW turbine generator was installed in 1987 to produce electricity to work the pumps and treatment works.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This spillway appears to be a combination of a straight chute and stepped spillway features. These are designed to reduce the kinetic energy of overflowing water and thereby reduce erosion damage. This system is essentially an uncontrolled system in that there are no mechanical gates or vanes to regulate the rate of overflow at the top of the dam.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One of the most picturesque and popular Dartmoor destinations. The abandoned quarries have been retaken by nature despite having been worked as recently as 1966. The quarries once supported an entire village of based here at Foggintor, with a School, Chapel and 30 cottages. The landscape will have looked very differently here two hundred years ago at the height of its industry. Now only evocative ruins remain.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Across the road from the parking area are the ruins of the old non-denominational Mission Hall, built in 1887 and demolished in 1965.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to problems at Foggintor school, the Mission Hall opened as a school on 17th August 1896 to house 41 pupils and soon that grew to 95 children. The school closed on 27th September 1912 and the children went to temporary schools at Merrivale and back to Foggintor Chapel until the new school opened at what is now known as Four Winds, on 19th April 1915.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the photograph above, Great Mis Tor is seen at top right.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cottages stood on the high ground on the left of the photograph (but to the right of the track) and were separated from their gardens by a back lane. The cottages were planned in 1846 and built by April 1849. They were probably demolished in 1953, the same year as Hill Cottages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to various Censuses, they were originally known as Mount Pleasant Cottages, then West View Cottages, and after that, Red Cottages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were built with cob and by 1871 the weather got into them so badly they were &amp;ldquo;covered with corrugated iron&amp;rdquo; and painted with red lead, thus becoming known as Red Cottages - this appears in the 1871 Census.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kath Brewer writes in &amp;ldquo;The Railways, Quarries and Cottages of Foggintor&amp;rdquo; that in later years they were actually black, having been covered with pitch, again against the weather.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were six cottages but with twelve dwellings - with &amp;ldquo;one up, one down&amp;rdquo;. In the 1861 Census, there were thirteen families with 50 adults and 38 children at West View, as the cottages were known at that time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A quarryman once stood at this point making Setts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Setts are granite blocks that were much used for paving roads and paths, and can still be seen in many cities, for they last a very long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rough cut setts blocks be brought here, such as cut from the Cake Stone above. To cut down on transport, the bankers typically set up very close by to the raw material, and their workplaces - bankers - were rough and ready; somewhere to stand and work the stone at around waist level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In exposed conditions, and this certainly qualifies, they would erect shelters to keep off the rain, snow and the worst of the wind. These would have been made of oilskin tarpaulin with a stick framework, probably on three sides, backed to the wind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tools were iron chisels and a hammer, with the working stone set on a bed on firm earth and granite chips, which would absorb the blows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a hard job. As well as the obvious difficulties of weather and repetitive, physical work; the sett-maker&amp;rsquo;s hearing will have suffered and worse, many will have suffered from silicosis from working granite and died early from lung problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stone here is the waste rock - where setts failed, often through cracks in the rock or where edges were trimmed off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional stonemasons still work very similarly to this, but now have tungsten tipped chisels and, when working with granite, a full-face respirator system.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When I worked for DNPA in the late 1980s, they often employed a traditional stonemason who would work just inside the entrance of the Works Depot in Bovey Tracey. He had a 45 gallon oil drum full of granite chips on which he&amp;rsquo;d place his work, which might be a perfectly spherical ball to sit atop a gatepost. He&amp;rsquo;d stand there all day, chipping away. Pausing every now and then to offer up a hardboard template to check his progress, or check diameter with a set of large calipers. He wore a full face respirator, with a battery pack and inlet on his belt at the back, similar to those used by industrial welders, which blew filtered air into the mask. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Royal Oak Quarry (later known as Foggintor) was worked from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, extracting granite that was taken away on the nearby railway line. This track was a horse-driven rail or tramway, so some deliveries will also have left this way to the road, as well as bringing supplies into the quarry and its accompanying village.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remains on the site include ruins of numerous buildings, large spoil tips and tracks, including that leading to the nearby Swell Tor Quarry, was closely associated. Foggintor was known to have included up to 30 cottages, a large Manager&amp;rsquo;s house, smithy, powder house, dressing sheds and stables.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Quarry was first dug in 1820, then known as Royal Oak Quarry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Through the 1830s through 1840s, up to 600 men were employed by the local quarries, some living at Foggintor and most journeying in each day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the 1861 Census, 267 people were registered as living at Foggintor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As well as Foggintor, Hill Quarry and Royal Oak Quarry, this was also known as Foggator - probably a local dialect corruption.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Houses of Parliament and Nelson&amp;rsquo;s Column were built from granite taken from this quarry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More locally, stone from here was used to build Tor Royal at Princetown, and likely some other Princetown buildings, although the Prison&amp;rsquo;s stone was mostly dug from the nearer Herne Hole Quarry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Foggintor Quarry was owned at one time by the Johnson Brothers who also took the lease on Haytor Quarry, but closed it and then sold stone from Foggintor Quarry under Haytor&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The quarry closed in 1966, putting 40 men out of work. One factor given was competition from cheaper sources abroad, and an increasing use of concrete instead of stone in architecture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The stones that form Big Tip are huge, especially on the lower levels. Approaching from the side you can see some must weigh many tons, and cracks in between are big enough to easily conceal an adult.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These scant foundations were once a schoolhouse and a Wesleyan Chapel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The quarry workers originally sent their children to the School at Princetown, which was then probably built in the Barracks. But when Dartmoor Prison was re-opened in 1850, a new building for the School was needed and was built here. At its peak in 1861, 183 pupils were known to regularly attend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note that this is not the later &amp;ldquo;Foggintor School&amp;rdquo;. That was also known as Four Winds and forms the large tree-lined car park half a mile south of our parking. We discuss that school &lt;a class="link" href="https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/the-merrivale-bronze-age-sun-calendar-and-foggintor-school/" >in our Merrivale Calendar walk&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between 1880 and 1883, this building was also recorded as a Wesleyan Chapel, and later a Workshop and again as a private residence, so it clearly served multiple purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By 1915 it was closed forever.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can see where a branch railway line was laid out along Big Tip to carry waste for tipping. The railway gauge was about 2-feet for easy man-handling. It is recorded that only 10% of quarried granite was used in building, the rest was waste. Looking at the size of these tips, it is easy to believe that disposing of waste rock was a large part of the works here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The purpose of the arch is unknown. There is a suggestion that a waterwheel was located here, but there seems to be no evidence to support that.&lt;/p>

These were active well within Walkhampton Parish, although quarrying had nothing to do with tithing and therefore wasn&amp;rsquo;t suitable for the purpose of the map.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There is a fair layby at the start of the track to Yellowmeade and Foggintor - which is in fact an old sand quarry. Please don&amp;rsquo;t block the track, it is in regular use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If that&amp;rsquo;s full, there&amp;rsquo;s usually some space opposite, and some more a short way towards Princetown by the old pump house.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In 1836 Ralph Lopes leased the area to George Stone Baron to &amp;lsquo;dig work mine and search for Iron, Iron Ore, Iron Stone and all other Ores&amp;rsquo; on what was then called Great Yennadon Common, the rent being 1s 8d in the on the gross value according to the price on the day of all such ores metals and minerals which shall be &amp;hellip; digged raised and gotten out of from or in the said premises&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There was no lease following this, so it must be concluded the venture was unsuccessful. In 1846, another license was issued to other adventurers!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first railway, the 1823 horse-drawn PDR of Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt has already been mentioned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second railway was the 1883 [Princetown Railway](&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princetown_Railway0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princetown_Railway0&lt;/a> (using steam locomotives) that replaced it, runnning from Yelverton to Princetown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one connected with the 1859 &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Devon_and_Tavistock_Railway" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>South Devon and Tavistock Railway Company (SD&amp;amp;TR) Plymouth-Tavistock line&lt;/a>. It was adopted by the GWR from 1st January 1922 and closed March 3rd, 1956.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The horse-drawn tramway consisted of short wagons that could be pulled in quite a tight turn. The line enters this image at the far right, from the gateway seen above, swings around a hairpin bend (kindly marked by the sheep) and doubles back towards the camera at the left, from where it goes through the first gate above up to Iron Mine Lane and on to Princetown via the west side of the Down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steam railway could not turn a tight bend like this and was built running into this image at the bottom left and on into the distance towards the reservoir where it ran around the flank of the Down above the dam to Burrator &amp;amp; Sheepstor Halt and then on to Princetown, travelling up the east side of the Down.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This grass triangle is no burial place - it is a triangular piece of land that was left so that a horse and cart could negotiate a fork in the road where three lanes meet; or maybe it built up from these cart and wagon turnings over the centuries: this is called a godcake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The so-called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Godcake" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

This is a crossroads where the left turn goes downhill to Welltown.

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A walk including some hills through Haytor and historic quarries from previous centuries. Points of interest include abandoned machinery, the Haytor Granite Tramway (The Templer Way), an abandoned partially-carved apple crusher and ruined buildings including a &amp;lsquo;beehive&amp;rsquo; quarryman&amp;rsquo;s hut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>We start from the Upper Haytor car park, marked on the map as the lower P and white/green cross. Walk upwards towards the imposing Haytor&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Haytor&lt;/strong> The name is a cartographer&amp;rsquo;s corruption of the local name of High Tor, pronounced in the Dartmoor dialect as &amp;ldquo;Hey Tor&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are granite intrusions that are seen from a long way off, even from The English Channel, and are hence, the &amp;ldquo;high tor&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With rock piles separated by an area of grass, it is also called an &amp;ldquo;avenue tor&amp;rdquo;. Other Avenue Tors are Bellever Tor, Hound Tor, Great Staple (or, originally, Steeple) Tor, Rippon Tor, and Pew Tor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rock climbers and abseilers use Haytor often.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On special occasions, a bonfire is sometimes set on the exposed flat rocks of Low Man by the local community in agreement with the local Authority and Landowner. These celebration fires, which have likely occured for millenia, can be seen for a huge distance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the very top of Low Man is a hole drilled by the Victorians to hold a flagpole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Victorians also carved steps into Haytor and erected a wrought-iron handrail to help them climb the rock with more ease. The steps, somewhat weathered, still exist, but only stubs of the ironwork remain. Stairs and a similar handrail still exist at Blackingstone Rock.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The adventurous may wish to climb Haytor. You will find the steps up the shallower grade, with a small leap across to the main rock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not an easy climb and advised only for the fit and agile with suitable footwear, and to be avoided by all in icy or windy weather for obvious reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>For our walk, we turn right in front of Haytor and head Northeast for about 500m&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This crane would have been used to lift blocks of rough-cut granite out of the quarry below, and also on and off wheeled trams for transport down the Haytor Granite Tramway for loading onto barges at Stover, and then by boat to Teignmouth for transport internationally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notably, granite from this quarry was used in many fine London buildings including Nelson&amp;rsquo;s Column and London Bridge.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-templer-family">The Templer Family
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>These quarries were started in 1813 by a George Templer (1781-1843), who also build the Haytor Granite Tramway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>George&amp;rsquo;s father, James Templer II (1748-1813) built &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stover_Canal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stover Canal&lt;/a> nearby, which was originally used to transport Ball Clay from the Bovey Basin to factories worldwide, including those used for Wedgewood Porcelain. The Stover canal was later also used for the export of stone from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>George&amp;rsquo;s grandfather, James Templer (1722-1782) built &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stover,_Teigngrace" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stover House&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, George overspent and he was forced to sell the family estate; Stover House, Stover Canal and the Haytor Granite Tramway. These were bought by &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_St_Maur,_11th_Duke_of_Somerset" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Edward St Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset&lt;/a> - &amp;ldquo;Lord Seymour&amp;rdquo; (1775-1855)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that time, Haytor quarries were leased by the Johnson Brothers in 1840, who closed them within a few years. It is known they were having problems with &amp;ldquo;the Union&amp;rdquo; and it seems likely this was linked. The brothers also leased Foggintor quarries and sold stone from there under the &lt;em>Haytor Granite Company&lt;/em> name, which was misleading to customers as the Haytor granite was known to be of better quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seven years later, the Haytor lease was up for renewal and the Duke refused to extend it, but the quarry never re-opened.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In 1986, as part of a Youth Training Scheme (YTS), I was part of a group of youths who carried water barrels, rope and pallets up to these quarries. We were tasked, as part of a confidence-building course run by Torbay Council, to build a raft and cross this pit.
These rings came in very useful in securing our pulling ropes &amp;ndash; &lt;cite>Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>At junctions the wheels were guided by &amp;lsquo;point tongues&amp;rsquo;, pivoted on the granite-block rails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This could be described as an early form of a railway &amp;ldquo;switchplate&amp;rdquo;. Authorities differ on whether the point tongues were oak or iron.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It can only be assumed these were cut for a future line or quarry that was never constructed, for they clearly hold no purpose.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are five separate quarries on Haytor Down: Haytor (Main) Quarry, Holwell Quarry, Rubble Heap Quarry, Harrow Barrow (Emsworthy East Quarry) and Western Quarry (Emsworthy West Quarry).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Emsworthy&amp;rdquo; names are sometimes used because of the proximity of Emsworthy (Hemsworthy) Rocks, between Haytor and Saddle Tor.&lt;/p>
