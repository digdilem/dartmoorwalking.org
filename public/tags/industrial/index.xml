&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a short walk of less than 3 miles, this area contains a huge amount of variation in terms of nature, geology and industrial history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staining on the ground by metalliferous leaching indicates that there are metal ores in this vicinity. This particular mine was dug for Tin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adits are horizontal tunnels used in mining. Some are used for access in and out and some are used for draining upper levels of water. This one is only open for about 10 meters, and was worked in tandem with the shafts on the slope immediately above it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would have been a spoil heap here when they were dug, but that has been removed by later activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of two wheelpits found here and is the earliest, showing on the 1841 Tithe Map. A large waterwheel once ran here and was to drive a series of flat-rods back and forth motion which carried the power to the nearby quarry where it powered pumps to keep the water free of water, which at its end reached a depth of 130 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a second wheelpit just upstream but it is known that both were not used together. They ceased operation by 1905.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wheels were fed by a reservoir above and a wooden launder (a basic 3-sided chute to run water down) and were of &amp;ldquo;pitch back&amp;rdquo; design, where water was added to the top of the wheel so that it filled buckets and drove the wheel back towards the wooden launder that supplied water. It was found that one reservoir didn&amp;rsquo;t supply enough water as the needs of the quarry grew and a second was added to increase flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second wheelpit housed a water wheel some 18 foot in diameter. The walls are better preserved than the first but quite overgrown. Behind it, there is a depression which is a &amp;ldquo;bob-pit&amp;rdquo;. This housed a large counter-weight which kept tension on the flat-rods as they worked to operate the quarry pumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Meldon Viaduct was built in 1874 by William Galbraith from wrought iron for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to connect Okehampton to Lydford and then on to Plymouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was widened to double-track in 1879 by building a second viaduct alongside, this one of steel, and joining the two. This was in service until 1968 when it became yet another victim of the Beeching Cuts. Meldon Quarry continued to use it up until the 1980s for shunting its trains until the track was removed in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now used by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Granite_Way&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;The Granite Way&lt;/a&gt; - a shared-use foot, cycle and bridlepath and is a scheduled monument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the quarry&amp;rsquo;s waste dumps, more properly named as &amp;ldquo;finger dumps&amp;rdquo; for their shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1800s the &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo; was taken in trucks to a series of corrugated iron buildings at the northern end of the east side tramway. A transfer shed was used where the finished material was consigned to wagons operating on an incline leading to the London and South Western Rail sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct. This incline becomes apparent as an earthwork partially obscuring the mouth of the early lime kiln. The crushed stone was used as ballast on railways and roads across the country and any unsuitable stone ended up here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This old limestone quarry, now flooded. It was used to dig a special Carbonifereous period limestone, not found anywhere else on Dartmoor, and much prized for producing lime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pool is about 130 feet deep, and when worked was kept drained by pumps driven by the water wheels earlier on our walk. This makes it deeper than the viaduct is high, that being a mere 120 foot tall at its highest span.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hundred years ago this site will have been very noisy and busy, with explosions and cranes operating, horse drawn carts rumbling around and men shouting. There will also have been rock crushers and stamps running within earshot, as well as steam trains going over the railway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carts of finished stone were weighed here before leaving for the railway. The design would have been similar to modern weighbridges and these metal grids formed the top layer of weighing scales that were read from within the weigh house. The quarry will have recorded its output using these figures, and from that set prices charged and paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lime kiln was built between 1880 and 1885.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lime was made in the kiln by setting alternating layers of limestone and charcoal made from coppiced hazel trees. Once the kiln was filled to the brim, the fire was lit and everything burned at a high temperature for three days, leaving behind quicklime, Calcium Oxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaked lime can be made, carefully, from lime by adding water. This process is called hydration and as the reaction is exothermic, a huge amount of heat is produced and this can be extremely dangerous. Quicklime was so named from the old word &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo;, as it acted like it was alive when water was added as it churned and boiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once made, quick and slaked lime have many uses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;: Increases the PH level of fields by being spread in powder form, transforming acidic soils into sweeter and more productive ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construction&lt;/strong&gt;: Lime Mortar has long been used for building, and is favoured even today for stone buildings instead of cement mortars, as it can move and even heal small cracks as it absorbs moisture. It&amp;rsquo;s also used as limewash for painting, and lime render to cover and stabilise walls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt;: Lime is used for all sorts of things, including paper, steel, sugar, paint and other processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;: In the right conditions, lime is also a disinfectant, and is used in purification methods.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the earlier kiln, built before an Okehampton Estate map of 1790 and originally serving a small nearby quarry. It became disused but was used again when the Meldon Pool quarry started up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is earliest building in the valley to exploit the local geology. The view is partially blocked by an inclined tramway that took quarried stone up to the railway viaduct, which was built in 1874.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wall may be part of the crushing house where waste was brought from the finger dumps to be crushed and taken past the kiln by tramway up to sidings for use as ballast on the railways, but this is not certain as little is recorded about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water was piped from the Red-a-ven brook to a turbine housed in this building, generating power for the quarry. Spent water was then released into a short brick-lined channel on the West side of the building to return to the brook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My guess from this base and similar designs is that this was a horizontal turbine with a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelton_wheel&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;pelton wheel&lt;/a&gt; with one or more jets coming in from the side to power them. A central shaft would then have transferred power into a generator mounted directly above it &lt;cite&gt;&amp;ndash;Simon&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere near to the turbine house there were once corrugated iron buildings that housed crushers. These worked previous spoil heaps, crushing limestone which was then loaded onto wagons on an incline that led to the railway sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stone ruin was once where explosives for the quarry were kept. Before each shift, the explosives handler would take only enough from here for that shift&amp;rsquo;s operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such handlers were often selected from the most careful and thorough of the workers, and would avoid carrying any iron tools, or even removed iron hobnails from their boots to reduce the chance of sparks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the walls are strong, explosives stores often had very weak roofs - typically made of stick and oilcloth. If there was an accident, then the force would be sent upwards instead of outwards and repairs to the building would therefore be relatively quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are mine shafts on the east bank of the river with two adits nearby, typical of tin mining. They exist as sub-circular hollows with rims of upcast soil on their downslope margins. They vary in diameter, most examples being in the area of 3 metres with one exceptional example of 6 metres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These modern buildings are associated with more recent quarrying after 1921. The site remained open for a further fifty years until around 1970 and provided stone for road metalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before these buildings, there was a failed glass bottle operation on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the late 19th century, investigations were being made concerning the production of granulite (a granular metamorphic rock) at Meldon. There seemed to be potential to establish both glass and china works at the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was little activity until 1920 when a syndicate from London decided to build a glass factory. Two furnaces were installed out of a planned 12, and about 500 men were required. However, by February 1921, the men had been laid off and new owners were being sought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No obvious features remain of a glass industry, but large amounts of broken glass fragments can be seen, mostly representing small medicine and cosmetic bottles.  &lt;cite&gt;&amp;ndash; (Western Morning News 29/03/1920&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meldon Dam was begun in 1970 and completed in 1974, making it the newest of Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s large dams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 55 meters (180 feet) high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 200 meters (660 feet) wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reservoir is stocked with Brown Trout for licenced angling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniquely, Meldon reservoir became the first water-supply body to produce electricity when a 500kW turbine generator was installed in 1987 to produce electricity to work the pumps and treatment works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spillway appears to be a combination of a straight chute and stepped spillway features. These are designed to reduce the kinetic energy of overflowing water and thereby reduce erosion damage. This system is essentially an uncontrolled system in that there are no mechanical gates or vanes to regulate the rate of overflow at the top of the dam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these plaques on Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s reservoirs were made of bronze and have been stolen in recent years for their scrap value. Hopefully this one does not appear to the thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once across the dam, we are back at the car park and our walk is complete&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note from Simon: My mother once drove this road alone at night in the 1980s and swears she saw a coffin lying in her path. She swerved and avoided it, but didn&amp;rsquo;t dare return to investigate. I know of no other reports of coffins on this road but the incident was very close to the ancient Lich Way of which she wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware at the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-the-lich-way&#34;&gt;About the Lich Way
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Lich Way is a 17 mile path across Dartmoor from beyond Bellever through to Lydford.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We join it on our way to the Powdermills for only a short distance, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting piece of Ancient Dartmoor history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to 1260, residents of the farms and villages in this area of Dartmoor belonged to the Parish of Lydford. This meant that as well as travelling off the moor to attend services, they were expected to bury their dead in the consecrated ground of Lydford, then a major and powerful town. Coffins were carried by ox or pony cart, strapped directly onto pack ponies, or carried by men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The route bears many memories of its purpose. There is a Coffin Wood, and many suitable large flat rocks along the route are identified as &amp;ldquo;Coffin Stones&amp;rdquo; where the heavy burden was laid so the carriers could rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lich or Lych? Both methods of spelling are in wide usage, both on Dartmoor and elsewhere. The word is thought to be derived from the German &amp;ldquo;leich&amp;rdquo; or Dutch &amp;ldquo;lijk&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Corpse&amp;rdquo;, so perhaps Lich is the more correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For more information about the Lich way, please see the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/2016/03/17/lych_way/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

		alt=&#34;Across the road, the new path that was made in 1999. The old path was down the road to the left at Cherry Brook Bridge - a path that had become very boggy. In the distance is Longaford Tor (left), Higher White Tor (centre) and Arch Tor (right). The diversion of the path can be seen as a kink on modern walking route maps&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-gunpowder&#34;&gt;About Gunpowder
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunpowder is a mixture of three components of varying proportions depending on intended use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder#Composition_and_characteristics&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;More info - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the production of gunpowder is complicated and is unsurprisingly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Powdermills site is also complicated. Everything (except for the water) entered the site at the Southern entrance. Various stages in production occurred going up through the site to the three incorporation mills at the north end and then coming back down through the site until final storage in a main magazine ready for shipment to buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunpowder, black powder or rock powder (local name) used for quarrying and mine blasting, is still used in fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composition is 75% saltpetre, 15% charcoal and 10% sulphur (aka brimstone or burning stone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamite, more powerful, was patented in May 1867 by Alfred Nobel. Its success as a superior explosive led to eventual closure of the mills in 1897.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ingredients, saltpetre (mostly from  India), sulphur (mostly from the Vesuvius and Stromboli regions of Italy) and the charcoal (made from local wood, especially alder or alder buckthorn), were ground separately in a grinding mill house. These were then blended in the required proportions in large barrels tumbled by waterwheels. This incorporated them  into a single compound using a combination of mixing, crushing and churning. This was a hazardous process that was governed by strict regulations and regular inspections. Only wooden and copper tools were allowed , so as to prevent sparks causing explosions.  The men had to wear leather aprons and sof-soled shoes, no hobnail boots. There is a story that one man, Silas Sleep, who took his breakfast and dinner to eat at work, always ate them both together, in case he was &amp;lsquo;blowed up&amp;rsquo; and sent to meet his maker before lunch time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Incorporation&amp;rdquo; was the first stage of production, in one of the three incorporation mills (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) at the top of the site, it resulted in a form of &amp;ldquo;cake&amp;rdquo;. It was probably at this stage that the powders were dampened with water to reduce &amp;ldquo;dust&amp;rdquo;  and prevent accidental explosions. This also helped the very soluble salpetre to mix into the porous charcoal. The resulting damp paste or &amp;ldquo;mill cake&amp;rdquo; was shaped into &amp;ldquo;corns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &amp;ldquo;ripe charge&amp;rdquo; that could be stored for a short period. It was then pressed down in e.g. a 2-ft square box to &amp;ldquo;press cake&amp;rdquo; about an inch thick. Originally this was a hand-powered process, like a cider press, but later a water wheel was used to drive the presses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stage was &amp;ldquo;corning&amp;rdquo; when slabs of cake were broken up with wooden mallets into a granular form. Later, water-powered machines were used. This involved rollers and then sieving through different sized meshes. The powder was then tumbled in rotating barrels or cylinders. These were covered with gauze to collect any small dust-sized particles. This was another water-wheel powered process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stage was &amp;ldquo;glazing&amp;rdquo;, where the grains were tumbled again, with graphite or black lead to give each grain of powder a waterproof coating. This made the powder suitabe for use in damp mines and quarrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last stage was &amp;ldquo;drying&amp;rdquo;, sometimes in the open air. Usually, this was done in heated &amp;ldquo;Gloom stoves&amp;rdquo;. These were heated by an iron furnace with the powder laid on trays stacked around it. Later, steam stoves were used to heat pipes near the trays. The process used a flue to take away any sparks and fumes to a chimney - and this is seen at the south, bottom end of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final product was packed in large oak barrels that were covered with leather to prevent spillage and from stray sparks entering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gunpowder quality was tested periodically using the proving mortar that lies beside the road going into the Powdermills site. The strength was determined by firing a 68 lb iron ball over a distance that was then measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the actual gunpowder makers or millers, the Powdermills employed coopers, blacksmiths, carpenters, wagoneers, carters, wheelwrights, stable staff and labourers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-powdermills-history&#34;&gt;The Powdermills History
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George Frean&lt;/strong&gt;, a Plymouth Alderman, founded the Plymouth &amp;amp; Dartmoor Gunpowder Company and opened Powdermills in 1844; it closed in 1897. It had employed about 100 men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Frean later teamed up with James Peek, one of three brothers importing tea - wanted a biscuit business for &amp;ldquo;tea and biscuits&amp;rdquo; - wrote to George Frean, &amp;ldquo;miller and ships biscuit maker&amp;rdquo;, who had married a niece of theirs, to manage &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peek_Freans&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Peak Freans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole complex was powered by water which was brought in by three leats. Initially, one leat came from the east bank of the Cherry Brook to a rectangular reservoir north of the three isolated incorporating mills. The water then returned to the Cherry Brook. The second leat came from the west side of the Cherry Brook to a circular reservoir behind the buildings. Water was taken for four years without Duchy permission. Permission was quickly granted because the Prince Consort, Prince Albert, had encouraged the venture. Later, water was also leated from the East Dart River to the north end reservoir. The water was then leated to water wheels used for grinding and powering other machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leat through the site is described in the book Industrial Archaeology of Dartmoor as now being dry and &amp;ldquo;two points at which it crosses the Cherry Brook, which flows between the buildings, can be seen. At one of these points, after feeding half the wheelhouses, the leat passes under the Cherry Brook through a wooden launder, which is still in place, in hard and excellent condition in spite of its years of saturation. Further downstream the leat&amp;rsquo;s channel back under the brook is of stone, big enough for a man to enter. The water had to be conveyed some way before being allowed to discharge, in order to prevent pollution of the Cherry Brook&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterwheels were used in the three massively-built incorporating mills (1,2,3 on the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;map.jpg&#34; &gt;map&lt;/a&gt;), glazing mill (4), pressing house (5) and two in the incorporating/composition mill and cartridge pressing house/corning/dusting house and glazing mill complex (6,7), and the final preparation rooms (8), making eight altogether. There is also a ninth, disused wheelpit at the final preparation rooms with later lean-tos in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate from the powder works to the south, along the road in, is the row of 19th century buildings that included cottages, a manager&amp;rsquo;s house, school, cooperage and a small Methodist chapel. Today, there is a pottery, offices and farm buildings. South of the cottages beside the road is the proving mortar and nearby is a wheel-binding stone, used for fixing hot iron rims to cart and wagon wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site - starting below at South Chimney after entering at the top of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be confusion identifying buildings when referring to the 2019 book and the 1990 survey listed above. The book starts at the south end of the site (page 98) with &amp;ldquo;Building 1&amp;rdquo; and the archaeogical survey starts from the north. The survey numbers are in (brackets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no known map saying what each building was used for, so there is conjecture based on the gunpowder-making processes and  the requirements for them to be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ready-made charcoal was brought in, then the South Chimney could have been for processing saltpetre, dissolving it and recrystallising it to make it more pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three phases of development and extension have been identified and it is likely that the function of the buildings changed over time. A flue and chimney indicate heat was involved. The flue to the chimney is about 1 metre deep and 1 metre wide. Its eastern portion is now open and rubble-filled, but the western portion is still capped. It enters the base of the chimney which is set on a plinth. The chimney is about 10.5 metres high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly a saltpetre crystallising house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long rectangular single-storey building located at the southern end of the site and aligned north to south.. Two, possibly three, phases have been identified. Water was culverted through the building under the floor. Its north wall was probably the dwarf wall which now subdivides it from the extension to the north. Dwarf walls in one interior consist of one long spine wall and two side walls. Another dwarf wall runs east to west across the structure from the northernmost door to the east wall. These appear to form a raised floor with water, air or heat circulating beneath. A small, square, stone-lined feature to the west of the south-west corner may be a well, or possibly a pit in which staves were soaked. The building is described in the book as the Watch House, where materials in and out of the site were monitored. It might also have been used as a store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small, rectangular, single-storey shed, in line with the track over the brook to the South Chimney. Aligned north to south. South gable end mostly survives. The west wall stands to full height; the east wall survives only as footings. No doors or windows are present in the three standing walls. There is plaster rendering on the interior. Small stone-lined channel runs east to west down the outside of, and parallel to, the south wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incorporating/composition mill (south), possible cartridge press house (south of N building) and possible corning/dusting house/glazing mill. Consists of two pairs of structures on either side of two wheelpits. The tailrace of the southern wheepit discharges back to the Cherrybrook. The wheel between the southern mill was powered by a continuation of the leat powering buildings to the north. The wheelpit tailrace discharged via a channel into Cherry Brook. The culvert has an arched roof of granite blocks overlain by slabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long rectangular building, aligned north / south. The structure contains supports for a raised floor, or to support machinery such as glazing barrels. The internal supports may alternatively have been to provide under-floor ventilation. There is a wheelpit at the south end of the building. This where &amp;ldquo;broken&amp;rdquo; pieces of gunpowder from the Breaking House were sieved and large pieces were returned to the Breaking House and fine powder was returned to the Press House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Circular Reservoir on the hill above between this building and the preceding building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is probable that these buildings were used for dusting, glazing, sieving and packing the gunpowder prior to carting it it off-site. Horses may have been stabled here as well as barrels and other materials being stored here. There are two mills powered by a waterwheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar in plan to &amp;lsquo;Buildings 1 and 2&amp;rsquo;, consisting of two units flanking a central wheelpit. The wheelpit is largely filled with rubble. The wheel was powered by water from the tailrace of the wheelpit of &amp;lsquo;Building 2&amp;rsquo;. The three incorporating mill houses (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) were of massive construction with many granite blocks being 6-feet long and the was about 6-feet thick, to withstand inadvertent explosions. The roofs were very flimsy, of wood and tar, to blow off without damaging the main structure. They could be replaced easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: 5 (1) Incorporating Mill:&lt;/strong&gt; Consists of a pair of gable-ended structures flanking a large central wheelpit. Both of massive granite blocks with walls about 2 metres thick at their bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tar dribbles indicate original roofing was of tarred tarpaulin or wood. This was probably to allow any accidental explosion to go upwards and leave the walls standing, a technique still used by artisinal powder makers in India and China today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wheelpit is aligned north-east to south-west and runs the whole width of the units. Wheel axle appears to have projected into their ground floors. Powered by a launder to the north-east which flowed out through a culvert to the south-west. This is roofed for 3.5 - 4 metres, then becomes an open channel which runs downhill to feed the reservoir belonging to &amp;lsquo;Building 2&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raised bank at the left brought the leat that fed a launder to the waterwheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proving mortar is just off the road, on the left, on the last bend when driving in approaching the Pottery, cafe and mill cottages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It fired a (probably) 68 lb ball to test the powder. The distance travelled by the ball was a measure of the strength of the powder and undoubtedly a good sales tactic for potential buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This walk was reached from a small roadside layby marked by the yellow cross below the &amp;ldquo;Lich Way Plaque&amp;rdquo; label on the map. Normally, for a group, it would be reached from the main car park in Postbridge or the car park in the forest just across the road from it. There is also a car park at Higher Cherry Brook Bridge,  marked with the P symbol and yellow cross on the map&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that there is no parking available at the Powdermills Pottery and shop except when visiting them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
