&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a pleasant and fairly easy walk. The terrain is mostly forestry paths, with some small sections of open moorland. The paths may have small puddles, and mud or ruts if there&amp;rsquo;s forestry work underway, but are generally well maintained.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this walk was first published, Dartmoor National Park have created a circular walk that also takes in these ancient sites in Bellever. The details may be available from the Visitor Centre at the start, but the route may differ from ours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please keep dogs under control. Bellever woods are conservation grazed by Dartmoor Ponies, and sheep may be present in the early section just after the Clapper Bridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>When you&amp;rsquo;re ready to leave, leave the car park and walk down the road a short distance and take the path to the right to the Clapper Bridge&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Postbridge Clapper was likely built in the Medieval period, around the 13th Century, but may be older than this as it&amp;rsquo;s impossibly to date accurately. What&amp;rsquo;s clear is that it was built to provide a safe crossing for the packhorse routes needing to cross the river, with stout ponies carrying wool and agricultural goods and later, supplying the tin mining industry. Today, the village of Postbridge remains a central and important location on Dartmoor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are hundreds of Clapper Bridges on Dartmoor, which are the simplest of stone structures relying purely on gravity - no interlocking joints or mortar are used. Postbridge is unusual in that the slabs are particularly large and would have been difficult to position. Partly because of their size, the bridge has proved remarkably resistant to flood damage over the centuries and has mostly survived without change. However, you may notice iron bands that help secure it now. These date from around the Victorian period onwards, being replaced when necessary, and more modern repairs may show epoxy resin filled holes from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most photographed bridges on Dartmoor and a very familiar sight to travellers.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just past the Oak Tree, using the road bridge in the picture above as a reference, there&amp;rsquo;s an old Mould stone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When tin ore was smelted at a blowing house, the tin was poured into mould stones to cool. These formed ingots of a specified shape and weight which were then carried off the moor to be sold. It&amp;rsquo;s not known why this stone is here - there&amp;rsquo;s no known blowing house nearby and they were too valuable to be easily discarded, but as we know this was a route travelled by tin miners, perhaps it fell unnoticed from a pack pony&amp;rsquo;s load.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bellever Forest was planted by the Duchy of Cornwall in 1921 to help replenish national wood supplies which were much depleted after the First World War.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bellever Complex is an internationally renowned archaelogical site, and forestry has obscured or damaged a large part of it.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Kraps ring is a Bronze Age settlement of around 9 stone hut circles within a partially enclosing perimeter wall of roughly 30 meters diameter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The name &amp;ldquo;Kraps&amp;rdquo; may derive from a local term meaning &amp;ldquo;Corpse&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Stone hut circles and hut settlements were the dwelling places of prehistoric farmers on Dartmoor. They mostly date from the Bronze Age, with the earliest examples on the Moor in this building tradition dating to about 1700 BC. The stone-based round houses consist of low walls or banks enclosing a circular floor area; remains of the turf or thatch roof are not preserved. The huts may occur singly or in small or large groups and may lie in the open or be enclosed by a bank of earth and stone. Although they are common on the Moor, their longevity and their relationship with other monument types provide important information on the diversity of social organisation and farming practices amongst prehistoric communities. They are particularly representative of their period and a substantial proportion of surviving examples are considered worthy of protection. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Historic England&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Heading Southwards, we cross the Lych Way at right angles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lych way is a medieval track starting from Bellever Village a short way to the East and continuing Westwards for around 10km, mostly across open moor, to Lydford Church. Church laws at the time forbade burial for this region except at that location, and the dead were carried there to be buried. There are several &amp;ldquo;Coffin stones&amp;rdquo; along the route where the coffin would be put whilst the bearers rested. The practice ceased in 1260 when the dead were allowed to be buried at Widicombe-in-the-Moor, although some still chose to be buried at Lydford.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even today, this route is associated strongly with supernatural happenings by some. The editor&amp;rsquo;s own mother once swerved to &amp;ldquo;avoid a coffin in the middle of the road&amp;rdquo; whilst driving alone at night.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>An impressive, but little known double stone row - one of several on Dartmoor. A medium walk through quiet woodland with some climbs on mostly firm forestry tracks.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The shed we park by was originally built for the forestry workers, but now is used mostly for storage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fernworthy forest was first planted in 1921 by the Duchy of Cornwall. At that time there was a national shortage of timber following the First World War and much was needed quickly, leading to a nationwide conifer planting scheme.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The forest comprises mostly of Sitka Spruce with some Douglas Fir and Japanese Larch. All are well suited to the Dartmoor conditions and provide a change of habitat for much wildlife. There are also pockets of deciduous woodland, notably around the reservoir.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Reservoir was built 1936-1942 by Torquay Water Authority and was the last granite dam built on Dartmoor at a cost of £246,000 - twice the original tender. It covers 76 acres and holds 380 million gallons. It&amp;rsquo;s 63 feet deep and water is piped to Trenchford Reservoir.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Start our walk by walking about 350m back along the road you entered by, and turning right into the Woodland through a gateway&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Lowton Brook West Settlement was described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 2 - The North, 35.4 - Lowton Brook West, page 157.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are eleven huts in this area, with this one being the furthest north, and the largest at 9.1 metres diameter. They date from the Bronze age, approximately 3300 BC to 1200 BC. The climate of Dartmoor was much milder then and many small settlements remain from human occupation of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each Hut Circle is the site of what was probably a fairly typical Bronze Age Roundhouse, with walls of stone and a thatched roof. A central firepit will have provided cooking and heat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the stone has been robbed by successive moor men, who used it for other buildings or walling, leaving the heavier base stones.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The hut circles probably came long after the stone row was erected, and it&amp;rsquo;s thought that the builders respected the row. Certainly, they did not steal its stones to build their huts, which would have been convenient.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The stone row is described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 2 - Asacombe Hill stone rows. This double row is similar to its neighbour on Hurston Ridge, a kilometre to the east. It is possible that a third row was planned but never installed, because the rows do not align well with the centre of the cairn.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Assycombe (Also Asacombe) Farm is the ruin of a deserted Medieval and Post-Medieval farmstead. There are two rectangular buildings with a field.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A shard of pottery recovered from this site has been positively dated to 13th-14th Century&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Longhouse to the South is the oldest of the two buildings.&lt;/li>
