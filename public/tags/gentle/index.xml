>Woodland Trust&lt;/a>, Pullabrook Woods is a lovely little area popular with dog walkers. There are woodland paths up the west side of the River Bovey, crossing it at a notable stone bridge, and back down the Eastern side, re-crossing close to the car park. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly lovely on a hot summer&amp;rsquo;s day as most is well shaded. The area is known for its wildlife, especially wild birds - with the rare Dartford Warbler, the Kingfisher and Pied Flycatcher seen here. There are also dormice, otter and bats with the river home to Salmon and Brown and Sea Trout.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="pullabrook-woods">Pullabrook Woods
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Also known as &amp;ldquo;Pullbrook Woods&amp;rdquo;, if only by Ordance Survey, these woodlands are 50 acres (20ha) in size and are a mix of ancient woodland and wildflower-rich wet meadows in the steep-sided valley of the River Bovey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name Pullabrook probably comes from the personal name, &amp;ldquo;Polla&amp;rdquo;, so in modern terms, &amp;ldquo;Polla&amp;rsquo;s Brook&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nearby Pullabrook Farm is mentioned in the Domesday book of 1086 where it is written as &amp;ldquo;Polebroc&amp;rdquo; and was seized by William the Conquerer as part of the Bovi estate when the Normans invaded. As a reward for his support, William gave this estate to Geoffrey de Mowbray the Bishop of Coutances. The current farmhouse dates from the sixteenth century and is Grade II listed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We briefly leave The Woodland&amp;rsquo;s Trust land and enter the bottom edge of Trendlebere Down, owned by English Heritage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This unsealed track is, in fact, a fully legal road and you may see cars and motorbikes using it as well as cyclists, horseriders and walkers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the road that travels above us on Trendlebere Down was built in the 19th Century, this was the original and main road between Bovey Tracey and Manaton.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s now a Byway Open to All Traffic (BOAT) which means any road going vehicle can legally use it provided they are taxed and insured - although much of it is only suitable to off road vehicles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The name &amp;ldquo;Pudding Stone&amp;rdquo; describe several types of rock around the world. In this case, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that this is just a natural lumps of granite that happens to resemble a pudding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you look closely, you will see that it has a inscribed feature of an arrow and line. This is a benchmark, likely carved during the 1800s when the Ordnance Survey did detailed mapping of the UK. There are over half a million of these symbols, some dating back to 1831, which provide a fixed point of reference. They are no longer created as technology has made them obsolete, but still a good reminder of how we created the most accurate maps in the world by measuring angles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hisley Bridge is a post-medieval bridge built some time between 1401 and 1750 to improve safe access over the river for pack horses when the river is in spate, making the ford difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pillar in the middle of the bridge is a modern addition to prevent off road vehicles from using the bridge, which had already caused damage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The viaduct once carried the GWR Moretonhampstead Railway Branch Line. This opened in 1866 as an independent line, and amalgamated with the GWR ten years later. British Rail nationalised it in 1948 and it closed in 1964 - another victim of Dr Beeching&amp;rsquo;s cuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part of this line remains from Newton Abbot to Heathfield, although it has not been used for several years. It was resurrected briefly in the 2000&amp;rsquo;s to take away timber from Teign Grace halt but has since been idle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see more evidence of the railway in many places from Newton Abbot to Moretonhampstead - such as the railway sheds at Bovey Tracey, many viaducts such as this, and some engine sheds at the Thompson&amp;rsquo;s lorry yard where it terminated. Much of the route is now a shared-use path for walkers, cyclists and horseriders.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a pleasant walk up a historic valley with plenty to see along the way. I&amp;rsquo;ve included a possible detour if you wanted to extend the walk to include Swincombe Intake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much of this land is owned by Anton Coaker who lives at Sherberton Farm who farms the distinctive red Galloway cattle and Dartmoor ponies on this land.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Coaker&amp;rsquo;s dedication to breeding good quality Dartmoor Ponies is well known and is several generations long. I recall visiting his mother, Diane Coaker, at Sherberton farm to view some of her ponies with my own mother in the 1980s. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Anton himself is very well known as the author of several books, newspaper articles and is a very knowledgeable and erudite writer on Moorland and Hill Farming matters.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Start the walk by proceeding back 140 meters along the road you approached the parking along, then turn right at the end of the wall along a Bridlepath&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dartmoor has had many fine dry stone wall builders, but perhaps the most famous of all was John Bishop (1821-1892). He was one of the first to use the shaped and squared building method in his walls. He tightly fitted large blocks of granite in such a way that very little daylight could be seen through the wall. He helped enclose many of the newtakes on Dartmoor and would have been in strong demand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When asked how he lifted such heavy stones, John Bishop is alleged to have replied, “Aw, ‘tis surprisin’ what ee can do with a laiver or two.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of the walls in this area were built or repaired by Mr Bishop who lived close by - we&amp;rsquo;ll visit his house on this walk - and are of a visibly better quality than most earlier walls, which were mostly built from natural moorstone, using &amp;ldquo;trigs&amp;rdquo; of small stone to wedge them in place. But no matter how well a dry stone wall is made, it needs repairing often due to weather and especially animals and people climbing it and loosening stone, so other men will have been involved over the years in keeping these walls stockproof.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dolly Trebble was a particularly attractive girl who caught the eye of many men of Dartmoor in the 18th Century. Despite being married to William Trebble, she was courted by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt (1762-1833) - an important man who shaped much of Princetown and Dartmoor, and no less than George IV, the Prince Regent who visited here several times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She was written about by Sabine Baring Gould and Dolly was clearly a woman of some fame. Tim Sandles has an entertaining version of Dolly&amp;rsquo;s story on his Legendary Dartmoor site if you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>When ready, proceed down to join the moor road to the west and walk a short way to the bridge over the river Swincombe, where you have a choice&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="detour-to-swincombe-intake">Detour to Swincombe Intake
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Possible detour (An extra mile and a half)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you continue walking along this road to the west, after around 1.2km you&amp;rsquo;ll come to the Swincombe Intake. This is a small reservoir and unusual art-deco building that collects water which is piped to Venford Reservoir to help fill it.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This valley starts up at Peat Cott with the infamous Foxtor Mire at its head, which acts as a huge sponge providing a steady flow throughout even the driest of summers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was that which prompted a plan in the 1960s to flood this entire valley to provide another reservoir on Dartmoor, far larger than the modest intake that has stood there for a hundred years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not surprisingly, this caused a lot of opposition. Perhaps the most vocal opponent was Lady Sylvia Sayer who, with the Dartmoor Preservation Association, resisted this at every turn. You will by now have noticed that you&amp;rsquo;re not under several meters of water, so it should be no surprise to learn that in 1970, the opposers won and permission was refused. Planning was retried several times through the 70s and 80s until in 1985, the DPA used funds from a bequest to acquire 50 acres of this valley to protect it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There has been a bridge at this location for hundreds of years, and noted by William Crossing in the early 1900s. It has been replaced several times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It earned its nickname as a small porcelain fairy was mounted to one of the supports by persons unknown. Unfortunately it was damaged and replaced at least once.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ore from the adit would be smashed down small enough to fit into the top hole of this stone which sat above the base stone. The top stone was then rotated, possibly by pony or donkey or water power, to grind the ore just as grain is turned into wheat. The resulting fine sand was then smelted to form ingots.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once smelted and the impurities floated off, the near-pure tin was poured into a mould stone to form a 200lb ingot. This was a standard weight for transporting by pony off the moor.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The chemical symbol for Tin is &amp;ldquo;Sn&amp;rdquo; which stands for stannous or stannic. From this comes the Latin for Tin, Stannum. From that, comes Stannator (Stannary parliament), stannary laws, stannary towns etc.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>When the Swincombe Intake was built in the 1920s, the builders needed to run a pipe from there to the Venford Reservoir some 6 kilometers away. They opted to reuse and extend this adit to run that pipe through.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is one of my favourite walks and is never busy, despite being so close to Haytor Rock. Most people seem to overlook Haytor Down in their eagerness to get into other parts of the moor but there is much to appreciate here, from stunning views over Teignmouth&amp;rsquo;s coastline, to an abandoned quarry, the stover granite tramway and a lovely stretch of ancient woodland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This walk can be done in either direction, but anti-clockwise is advised, as you can then appreciate the views full as you walk down the Granite Tramway.&lt;/p>

>Geocaching&lt;/a> is a game of finding hidden containers using a GPS or Smart Phone. The containers have a small paper log which you sign to prove you were there, and a website where you log your find. Basic membership is free. If this sounds a lot like Letterboxing, that&amp;rsquo;s because it is based on it, but brought up to date. Many Dartmoor walkers and Letterboxers also geocache as they go hand in hand, and Geocaches are a good way to find interesting places to explore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a series of Geocaches that follow this walk (that&amp;rsquo;s why I know this area, I set these caches and walk this route to maintain them once or twice a year!) If that sounds interesting, pop over to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC4VD4J" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>first cache page of the series&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>We follow this old tramway for about a mile downhill&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This tramway was built on the instruction of George Templer (1781-1843), a family that also built the main Haytor Quarries, the Stover Canal and Stover House in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The gauge of this tramway is 4'3&amp;quot; and it&amp;rsquo;s taken from granite cut and shaped at the Haytor quarries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are sets of points further up the tramway where the trams could be steered into different quarries or sidings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Granite cut from Haytor or Holwell Quarries was loaded onto strong wooden trucks (See picture below)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Tramway runs down from Haytor Rocks to Stover Canal, where the granite would be transferred to sailing barges to take it to Teignmouth docks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Around 12 of these trucks were connected together in a &amp;ldquo;train&amp;rdquo; with the iron wheels sitting in the flat sections.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A team of around 18 horses was then connected in single file to one end of the train. If it was loaded and heading downhill, the horses would be fixed to the last truck to provide braking. If they were pulling the trucks back up from Stover, they would be hitched to the front to better pull.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The tramway is intact for much of its original course, down through Yarner Woods, past Bovey and on to Stover.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The sound of running water will alert you to this large collector tank above the path - it always seems to be overflowing even in the driest summer, and runs across the path here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The water is fed into this tank from a blue alkathene pipe, which continues up the hill over loose waste rock. If you follow it, it actually enters a gated Adit which is always dripping and provides a clearly sufficient flow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You may spot some rooftops downhill as you&amp;rsquo;re walking along. These belong to Yarner House. This is a Grade II Listed Tudor house dating back to the 1600s and has been renovated to a luxurious standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Yarner House estate is 247 acres.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It was part of the Manor of Bovey Tracey which William the Conqueror (Norman invader of 1066, also known as William the Bastard) siezed and then granted to Geoffrey de Mowbray, Bishop of Coutances.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On de Mowbray’s death in 1093, his nephew, Robert Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, inherited, but later defied the king, which led to the seizure of his estates in 1095.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eventually, ownership of the Bovey Tracey estates reverted to the Crown until, in the 16th century, a succession of costly wars left Tudor monarchs strapped for cash.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Elizabeth I began to sell off Crown properties and, in 1578, the Yarner estate was bought by Gregory Sprint, a canny lawyer with good Court connections, who swiftly resold it at a profit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The estate includes Yarner Woods, which is managed by Natural England and has several miles of woodland paths open to the public.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are copper mines in Yarner woods which, combined with other mines and quarries contributed to the wealth of the estate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Today, it is a Hotel that offers Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Hutholes is an interesting place and many have seen the strange name on the OS map and wondered about it. Its history is interesting and worth a visit. There are often a very nice heard of Dartmoor ponies grazing around Wind Tor and Southern Hamel Down. (Please keep your distance and definitely do not feed)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the bank opposite the starting car park is this modern stone, dating from 2008. The former gatepost was donated by a Mr R Whale and was carved by the Dartmoor National Park Authority using their stonemason, Andy Cribbett. When completed, a ceremony was held on the 10th of July 2008 and the stone placed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But why?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This location is the point where the manors of Jordon, Blackslade, Dunstone and Widecombe town intersect. Always known as ‘Two Crosses in the Turf’ this location was always marked by two crosses cut into the turf, every year the village lengthsman would re-cut them to ensure of their visibility. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/2016/03/31/two_crosses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>When I was about 12 years old in the mid 1980s, I stayed for a short time at the nearby Rowden Adventure Centre. We walked up here and we were shown the first Letterbox which was hidden under these rocks, which helped spark a lifelong interest in finding tupperware in crevices &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Hutholes was a settlement of six buildings dating back to the Saxon period. It was certainly occupied at the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066 and seized by the invading French.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Daily routine revolved around farming, growing crops, animal husbandry and household chores.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Abandoned some time in the 14th century, it lay largely forgotten until 1963 when the local farmer, Mr Hermon French, talked about it to a Mrs Minter, who organised an archaeological dig,&lt;/p>

&lt;p>House 3, believed to be occupied up to the 12th century. This was probably original Depdona Manor house. The name was later changed to Dewdon and once this site was abandoned, was relocated half a mile away and renamed again, this time to Jordan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Domesday Book (1066 AD), Depdona was owned by a wealthy Englishman called Alric. By 1086 it had been relinquished to one of the conquerors, William de la Falaise &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; (Butler, Vol. 1 page 142)&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A Corn Ditch Wall is an artificial barrier separating grazing land and the common moorland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where it differs from a normal wall is that the land approaching it from the moor side is steep and difficult to negotiate, but the earth on the other side ramps up to its top. This is to allow animals to leave the richer farm grazing and venture forth onto the moor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The name is said to come from this being the place where a local farmer always heard the first cuckoo, although one can also believe that it looks like a cuckoo&amp;rsquo;s egg in a nest of small eggs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These stone circles were rediscovered in 1921 when covering heather was burnt off during a drought, and the rings re-erected. It is possible that they were not replaced in the correct positions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also some evidence for a double stone row at this point.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Belstone is one of the prettiest villages on Dartmoor and retains a strong farming link. The large lawn slopes away down to an ancient ford and often has Dartmoor Ponies and sheep grazing. This was once a mining village, with the valley between Belstone and Sticklepath hugely industrialised, although it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see traces of that now.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once present in most villages, stocks were used to shame and punish transgressors - often for crimes against the church. The victim was secured in place so that anyone passing could taunt them, or throw rotten fruit at them - I&amp;rsquo;m sure many old grudges were settled here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stocks themselves have been replaced many times, and it&amp;rsquo;s reported that a blow up doll was punished here for the village&amp;rsquo;s Millenium celebrations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This celtic cross has moved around. Believed carved between the 7th and 9th centuries AD, William Crossing writes that it was rediscovered at this chapel when some stairs were taken down in 1861. It was then taken to a nearby rectory and built into a wall. It was returned here in 1920 when the Old Rectory was abandoned&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here were once nine young ladies who dared to dance on the Sabbath and were so turned to stone. A single stone apart from the others was the piper who played a tune for them, and he was similarly treated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently, if you visit at noon or when the Belstone church bells ring, you can see the stones swaying gently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This stone circle was originally a burial mound or kistvaen covered in earth. The grave was robbed many years ago, and the mound of earth to the Southwest was likely what was dug off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As known as: The Dancing Stones. The Seventeen Brothers. The Nine Stones.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One of the most picturesque and popular Dartmoor destinations. The abandoned quarries have been retaken by nature despite having been worked as recently as 1966. The quarries once supported an entire village of based here at Foggintor, with a School, Chapel and 30 cottages. The landscape will have looked very differently here two hundred years ago at the height of its industry. Now only evocative ruins remain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Across the road from the parking area are the ruins of the old non-denominational Mission Hall, built in 1887 and demolished in 1965.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to problems at Foggintor school, the Mission Hall opened as a school on 17th August 1896 to house 41 pupils and soon that grew to 95 children. The school closed on 27th September 1912 and the children went to temporary schools at Merrivale and back to Foggintor Chapel until the new school opened at what is now known as Four Winds, on 19th April 1915.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the photograph above, Great Mis Tor is seen at top right.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The cottages stood on the high ground on the left of the photograph (but to the right of the track) and were separated from their gardens by a back lane. The cottages were planned in 1846 and built by April 1849. They were probably demolished in 1953, the same year as Hill Cottages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to various Censuses, they were originally known as Mount Pleasant Cottages, then West View Cottages, and after that, Red Cottages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were built with cob and by 1871 the weather got into them so badly they were &amp;ldquo;covered with corrugated iron&amp;rdquo; and painted with red lead, thus becoming known as Red Cottages - this appears in the 1871 Census.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kath Brewer writes in &amp;ldquo;The Railways, Quarries and Cottages of Foggintor&amp;rdquo; that in later years they were actually black, having been covered with pitch, again against the weather.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were six cottages but with twelve dwellings - with &amp;ldquo;one up, one down&amp;rdquo;. In the 1861 Census, there were thirteen families with 50 adults and 38 children at West View, as the cottages were known at that time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A quarryman once stood at this point making Setts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Setts are granite blocks that were much used for paving roads and paths, and can still be seen in many cities, for they last a very long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rough cut setts blocks be brought here, such as cut from the Cake Stone above. To cut down on transport, the bankers typically set up very close by to the raw material, and their workplaces - bankers - were rough and ready; somewhere to stand and work the stone at around waist level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In exposed conditions, and this certainly qualifies, they would erect shelters to keep off the rain, snow and the worst of the wind. These would have been made of oilskin tarpaulin with a stick framework, probably on three sides, backed to the wind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tools were iron chisels and a hammer, with the working stone set on a bed on firm earth and granite chips, which would absorb the blows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a hard job. As well as the obvious difficulties of weather and repetitive, physical work; the sett-maker&amp;rsquo;s hearing will have suffered and worse, many will have suffered from silicosis from working granite and died early from lung problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stone here is the waste rock - where setts failed, often through cracks in the rock or where edges were trimmed off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditional stonemasons still work very similarly to this, but now have tungsten tipped chisels and, when working with granite, a full-face respirator system.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When I worked for DNPA in the late 1980s, they often employed a traditional stonemason who would work just inside the entrance of the Works Depot in Bovey Tracey. He had a 45 gallon oil drum full of granite chips on which he&amp;rsquo;d place his work, which might be a perfectly spherical ball to sit atop a gatepost. He&amp;rsquo;d stand there all day, chipping away. Pausing every now and then to offer up a hardboard template to check his progress, or check diameter with a set of large calipers. He wore a full face respirator, with a battery pack and inlet on his belt at the back, similar to those used by industrial welders, which blew filtered air into the mask. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;bumps&amp;rdquo; on the left skyline are high-level waste tips while the enormous waste tip to the right is named &amp;ldquo;Big Tip&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Royal Oak Quarry (later known as Foggintor) was worked from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, extracting granite that was taken away on the nearby railway line. This track was a horse-driven rail or tramway, so some deliveries will also have left this way to the road, as well as bringing supplies into the quarry and its accompanying village.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remains on the site include ruins of numerous buildings, large spoil tips and tracks, including that leading to the nearby Swell Tor Quarry, was closely associated. Foggintor was known to have included up to 30 cottages, a large Manager&amp;rsquo;s house, smithy, powder house, dressing sheds and stables.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Quarry was first dug in 1820, then known as Royal Oak Quarry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Through the 1830s through 1840s, up to 600 men were employed by the local quarries, some living at Foggintor and most journeying in each day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the 1861 Census, 267 people were registered as living at Foggintor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As well as Foggintor, Hill Quarry and Royal Oak Quarry, this was also known as Foggator - probably a local dialect corruption.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Houses of Parliament and Nelson&amp;rsquo;s Column were built from granite taken from this quarry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More locally, stone from here was used to build Tor Royal at Princetown, and likely some other Princetown buildings, although the Prison&amp;rsquo;s stone was mostly dug from the nearer Herne Hole Quarry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Foggintor Quarry was owned at one time by the Johnson Brothers who also took the lease on Haytor Quarry, but closed it and then sold stone from Foggintor Quarry under Haytor&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The quarry closed in 1966, putting 40 men out of work. One factor given was competition from cheaper sources abroad, and an increasing use of concrete instead of stone in architecture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The stones that form Big Tip are huge, especially on the lower levels. Approaching from the side you can see some must weigh many tons, and cracks in between are big enough to easily conceal an adult.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These scant foundations were once a schoolhouse and a Wesleyan Chapel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The quarry workers originally sent their children to the School at Princetown, which was then probably built in the Barracks. But when Dartmoor Prison was re-opened in 1850, a new building for the School was needed and was built here. At its peak in 1861, 183 pupils were known to regularly attend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note that this is not the later &amp;ldquo;Foggintor School&amp;rdquo;. That was also known as Four Winds and forms the large tree-lined car park half a mile south of our parking. We discuss that school &lt;a class="link" href="https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/the-merrivale-bronze-age-sun-calendar-and-foggintor-school/" >in our Merrivale Calendar walk&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between 1880 and 1883, this building was also recorded as a Wesleyan Chapel, and later a Workshop and again as a private residence, so it clearly served multiple purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By 1915 it was closed forever.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can see where a branch railway line was laid out along Big Tip to carry waste for tipping. The railway gauge was about 2-feet for easy man-handling. It is recorded that only 10% of quarried granite was used in building, the rest was waste. Looking at the size of these tips, it is easy to believe that disposing of waste rock was a large part of the works here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Much of the research for this walk was taken from Kath Brewer&amp;rsquo;s book, The Railways, Quarries and Cottages of Foggintor, Orchard Publications, Chudleigh, Newton Abbot, 1997. The cottage about the arch was her home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The purpose of the arch is unknown. There is a suggestion that a waterwheel was located here, but there seems to be no evidence to support that.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There is a fair layby at the start of the track to Yellowmeade and Foggintor - which is in fact an old sand quarry. Please don&amp;rsquo;t block the track, it is in regular use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If that&amp;rsquo;s full, there&amp;rsquo;s usually some space opposite, and some more a short way towards Princetown by the old pump house.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In 1836 Ralph Lopes leased the area to George Stone Baron to &amp;lsquo;dig work mine and search for Iron, Iron Ore, Iron Stone and all other Ores&amp;rsquo; on what was then called Great Yennadon Common, the rent being 1s 8d in the on the gross value according to the price on the day of all such ores metals and minerals which shall be &amp;hellip; digged raised and gotten out of from or in the said premises&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There was no lease following this, so it must be concluded the venture was unsuccessful. In 1846, another license was issued to other adventurers!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The horse-drawn tramway consisted of short wagons that could be pulled in quite a tight turn. The line enters this image at the far right, from the gateway seen above, swings around a hairpin bend (kindly marked by the sheep) and doubles back towards the camera at the left, from where it goes through the first gate above up to Iron Mine Lane and on to Princetown via the west side of the Down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steam railway could not turn a tight bend like this and was built running into this image at the bottom left and on into the distance towards the reservoir where it ran around the flank of the Down above the dam to Burrator &amp;amp; Sheepstor Halt and then on to Princetown, travelling up the east side of the Down.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This grass triangle is no burial place - it is a triangular piece of land that was left so that a horse and cart could negotiate a fork in the road where three lanes meet; or maybe it built up from these cart and wagon turnings over the centuries: this is called a godcake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The so-called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Godcake" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>However, that is not accurate&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In 1905, the Western Morning News and other papers published a story about this stone, claiming it was a buried quoit or dolmen with a worked capstone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can be fairly sure that this report was inaccurate thanks to &lt;cite>William Crossing, who wrote in Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Early History &amp;amp; Medieval remains, Chap 12&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>eventually a man was found before any scientific paper was written who pronounced: &amp;ldquo;Twadn&amp;rsquo;t no old man cut thacky stone,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;I cut&amp;rsquo;n.&amp;rdquo; This is an abandoned top-stone to a crazing mill, an old way of grinding tin ore before it was smelted.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the distance we can see Merrivale Quarry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William Duke opened this as &amp;ldquo;Tor Quarry&amp;rdquo; in 1876, its operations absorbing the old sett-making craft previously carried out under the Staple Tors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As well as cutting setts, Granite from this quarry was also used for Gravestones, agricultural rollers and the like. It also provided the facing for the New Scotland Yard building in London.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The quarry closed in 1997, spending its final years dressing imported stone from Norway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name &amp;ldquo;Merrivale&amp;rdquo; for this part of Walkhampton Common is said to derive from &amp;ldquo;mara val&amp;rdquo; in old Cornish, meaning &amp;ldquo;plague market&amp;rdquo;. This is thought to have been corrupted from &amp;ldquo;tin market&amp;rdquo;, although &amp;ldquo;potato market&amp;rdquo; has also been suggested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In times of the Black Death (1348-1353: when 50 million people died in Europe (Not to be confused with the Great Plague of London, 1665-1666), farmers left food here for Tavistock people who left coins as payment soaking in vinegar to clean them of the badness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Mar val&amp;rdquo; has also been interpreted as Mirey Vale.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Early, possibly medieval or even earlier, tin workings where tinners collected alluvial deposits along stream beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The eroded tin ore could form quite pure tin gravel in such areas, having been washed down from the surrounding granite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The early tinners &amp;ldquo;leated&amp;rdquo; water to a trench at the lower end of the ground, called a &amp;rsquo;tye&amp;rsquo; and water was used to wash away the lighter &amp;lsquo;gangue&amp;rsquo; gravels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method left banks of waste behind. The area is surrounded by a scarp that shows the original level of the land and the depth of the deposits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tin streaming was often followed by open cast mining to go deeper, into big cuttings called &amp;ldquo;gerts&amp;rdquo;, but this is not seen here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was presumably this water source that was diverted and used for washing away the lighter sediments so as to leave the heavier tin-bearing gravels and sands for smelting. This would have been among the earliest tin-extraction methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This photograph also shows the scarp surrounding this area that suggests how much the early tinners changed the look of the landscape.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the Middle Ages,this trading route was very important, especially for wool and cloth or yarn, going via Sheepstor - which was famed for its sheep and wool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The track was superseded by the turnpike road in 1792.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strangers to the moor often had to tackle this high lonely route, this section over the Princetown area was the highest part and the most exposed. Princetown, or Thomas Tyrwhitt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Prince&amp;rsquo;s Town&amp;rdquo;, did not exist in those days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Guide posts were erected along the way and what we see today are possibly the more &amp;lsquo;modern&amp;rsquo; (1669) improved series, which were sponsored by Plymouth Corporation at the princely sum of £2.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Four Winds was the site of Foggintor School, built 1914, opened April 1915 with 55 children from the nearby cottages associated with Foggintor and other quarries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr &amp;amp; Mrs Stoyle were the teachers, it was a spacious building with a wood block floor and central heating - the pipes were used for warming their pasties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were periods of closure due to snow and whooping cough. The garden had bees, poultry, a goat and rabbits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the school building there was also School House, for the teachers. One section of the enclosure was the playing field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The school was run throughout its history by Fred Stoyle, the youngest head-teacher in the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their son, Ivan, planted the Christmas tree from 1924 in the school garden and this is the tree that stands there today - over a hundred years later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the school closed in 1936, the teachers&amp;rsquo; house was renamed &amp;ldquo;Four Winds&amp;rdquo;. The school buildings were demolished in 1964 and the private house in 1965.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stone from the buildings was used in the road modifications at Devil&amp;rsquo;s Elbow near Princetown. From this, we know that the tree is in the old garden and the other enclosure used to be the play area.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="foggintor-mission-school">Foggintor Mission School
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Before Foggintor School was built, there was another school opposite the entrance to the track to Yellowmead. This was in the Foggintor Mission Hall, built in 1887. It served also as a school from Aug. 1896, opening with 41 pupils.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It had 95 pupils in 1903 and closed in Sep. 1912. The building was demolished in 1965. The numbers of young children give some idea of the population in the area, associated mainly with the busy quarries.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Ten Commandments stone is a piece of natural granite that has been cut and shaped and engraved to show the ten commandments, plus an eleventh!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This walk starts with a gentle uphill route along some nice granite walling with some good views to the North to the Tor where the stone is to be found. The return route takes in some relatively unknown Welstor Common Rifle Range, dating back to 1861 and pre-dates the much larger training range to the East.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Leave the car park across the road to the Southwest&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The old (left in this picture) and new boundary stones, marked A, B and EPB as above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Welstor Newtake wall behind was built in 1771 to enclose open moorland for grazing. We keep it on our left all the way to Buckland Beacon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Historically, on Dartmoor, &amp;ldquo;newtakes&amp;rdquo; were enclosures of common land for agricultural purposes, and also to exclude others from grazing it. This practice often led to conflict between commoners who held rights over the land, and the landowners who erected these walls.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reaching Buckland Beacon, we pass by on its left side and find the commandment stones laying open like the pages of a book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stones were commissioned by William Whitely of Wellstor, Lord of Buckland Manor, in 1928, in celebration of the rejection by Parliament of a proposed new Book of Common Prayer that was deemed &amp;ldquo;too popish&amp;rdquo; by many.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two dates on the stones: 15th Dec 1927 and 14 June 1928, that are the dates on which the revised book was rejected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When it was realised that there would be room to spare, the third verse of the hymn &amp;ldquo;Oh God our help in ages past&amp;rdquo; was added to the second stone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are 1,547 letters on the two stones and, due to weathering, the stones have needed to be recut several times, sometimes highlighted in black paint to aid legibility. This recutting is known to have happened in 1995, 2009, 2017 and most recently in 2020 as part of the &amp;ldquo;Moor than Meets the Eye&amp;rdquo; project.&lt;/p>

>Welstor Common rifle range page&lt;/a> states: The target storehouse/shelter with its massive stone wall facing the firing lines. This rifle range was created in 1861 for the use of the Ashburton Rifle Volunteers. It was in use until about 1900, the 1905 OS map does not record it. There is very little evidence on the ground with the exception of this structure which was near the west end of the stop butt. There is a partially collapsed corrugated iron roof inside. the small quarry to the southwest appears to post date the rifle range.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;On Wednesday 16th February 1910 Mr J T Barker presided at a meeting in the Market Hall to discuss and consider the proposed golf club for Ashburton.
The chairman stated that a committee had already been appointed to try and find a suitable location for the course and as a result a large portion of land on Welstor Common had been obtained.
It had been generously offered by Mr Parnell Tucker at a nominal rent, he was also willing to erect a clubhouse which could also be rented.
The area had been inspected by several experts and a professional all of them were strongly in favour of the location.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;li>&lt;em>Note from Simon: My mother once drove this road alone at night in the 1980s and swears she saw a coffin lying in her path. She swerved and avoided it, but didn&amp;rsquo;t dare return to investigate. I know of no other reports of coffins on this road but the incident was very close to the ancient Lich Way of which she wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware at the time.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="about-the-lich-way">About the Lich Way
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Lich Way is a 17 mile path across Dartmoor from beyond Bellever through to Lydford.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We join it on our way to the Powdermills for only a short distance, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting piece of Ancient Dartmoor history.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prior to 1260, residents of the farms and villages in this area of Dartmoor belonged to the Parish of Lydford. This meant that as well as travelling off the moor to attend services, they were expected to bury their dead in the consecrated ground of Lydford, then a major and powerful town. Coffins were carried by ox or pony cart, strapped directly onto pack ponies, or carried by men.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The route bears many memories of its purpose. There is a Coffin Wood, and many suitable large flat rocks along the route are identified as &amp;ldquo;Coffin Stones&amp;rdquo; where the heavy burden was laid so the carriers could rest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lich or Lych? Both methods of spelling are in wide usage, both on Dartmoor and elsewhere. The word is thought to be derived from the German &amp;ldquo;leich&amp;rdquo; or Dutch &amp;ldquo;lijk&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Corpse&amp;rdquo;, so perhaps Lich is the more correct.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For more information about the Lich way, please see the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/2016/03/17/lych_way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="about-gunpowder">About Gunpowder
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Gunpowder is a mixture of three components of varying proportions depending on intended use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder#Composition_and_characteristics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>More info - Wikipedia&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the production of gunpowder is complicated and is unsurprisingly dangerous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Powdermills site is also complicated. Everything (except for the water) entered the site at the Southern entrance. Various stages in production occurred going up through the site to the three incorporation mills at the north end and then coming back down through the site until final storage in a main magazine ready for shipment to buyers.&lt;/p>

alt="This DNPA Notice on the first Incorporation Mill explains the process"
class="gallery-image"
data-flex-grow="177"
data-flex-basis="426px"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gunpowder, black powder or rock powder (local name) used for quarrying and mine blasting, is still used in fireworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The composition is 75% saltpetre, 15% charcoal and 10% sulphur (aka brimstone or burning stone).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dynamite, more powerful, was patented in May 1867 by Alfred Nobel. Its success as a superior explosive led to eventual closure of the mills in 1897.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ingredients, saltpetre (mostly from India), sulphur (mostly from the Vesuvius and Stromboli regions of Italy) and the charcoal (made from local wood, especially alder or alder buckthorn), were ground separately in a grinding mill house. These were then blended in the required proportions in large barrels tumbled by waterwheels. This incorporated them into a single compound using a combination of mixing, crushing and churning. This was a hazardous process that was governed by strict regulations and regular inspections. Only wooden and copper tools were allowed , so as to prevent sparks causing explosions. The men had to wear leather aprons and sof-soled shoes, no hobnail boots. There is a story that one man, Silas Sleep, who took his breakfast and dinner to eat at work, always ate them both together, in case he was &amp;lsquo;blowed up&amp;rsquo; and sent to meet his maker before lunch time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Incorporation&amp;rdquo; was the first stage of production, in one of the three incorporation mills (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) at the top of the site, it resulted in a form of &amp;ldquo;cake&amp;rdquo;. It was probably at this stage that the powders were dampened with water to reduce &amp;ldquo;dust&amp;rdquo; and prevent accidental explosions. This also helped the very soluble salpetre to mix into the porous charcoal. The resulting damp paste or &amp;ldquo;mill cake&amp;rdquo; was shaped into &amp;ldquo;corns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was &amp;ldquo;ripe charge&amp;rdquo; that could be stored for a short period. It was then pressed down in e.g. a 2-ft square box to &amp;ldquo;press cake&amp;rdquo; about an inch thick. Originally this was a hand-powered process, like a cider press, but later a water wheel was used to drive the presses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next stage was &amp;ldquo;corning&amp;rdquo; when slabs of cake were broken up with wooden mallets into a granular form. Later, water-powered machines were used. This involved rollers and then sieving through different sized meshes. The powder was then tumbled in rotating barrels or cylinders. These were covered with gauze to collect any small dust-sized particles. This was another water-wheel powered process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next stage was &amp;ldquo;glazing&amp;rdquo;, where the grains were tumbled again, with graphite or black lead to give each grain of powder a waterproof coating. This made the powder suitabe for use in damp mines and quarrying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last stage was &amp;ldquo;drying&amp;rdquo;, sometimes in the open air. Usually, this was done in heated &amp;ldquo;Gloom stoves&amp;rdquo;. These were heated by an iron furnace with the powder laid on trays stacked around it. Later, steam stoves were used to heat pipes near the trays. The process used a flue to take away any sparks and fumes to a chimney - and this is seen at the south, bottom end of the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final product was packed in large oak barrels that were covered with leather to prevent spillage and from stray sparks entering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The gunpowder quality was tested periodically using the proving mortar that lies beside the road going into the Powdermills site. The strength was determined by firing a 68 lb iron ball over a distance that was then measured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the actual gunpowder makers or millers, the Powdermills employed coopers, blacksmiths, carpenters, wagoneers, carters, wheelwrights, stable staff and labourers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-powdermills-history">The Powdermills History
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>George Frean&lt;/strong>, a Plymouth Alderman, founded the Plymouth &amp;amp; Dartmoor Gunpowder Company and opened Powdermills in 1844; it closed in 1897. It had employed about 100 men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>George Frean later teamed up with James Peek, one of three brothers importing tea - wanted a biscuit business for &amp;ldquo;tea and biscuits&amp;rdquo; - wrote to George Frean, &amp;ldquo;miller and ships biscuit maker&amp;rdquo;, who had married a niece of theirs, to manage &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peek_Freans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Peak Freans&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole complex was powered by water which was brought in by three leats. Initially, one leat came from the east bank of the Cherry Brook to a rectangular reservoir north of the three isolated incorporating mills. The water then returned to the Cherry Brook. The second leat came from the west side of the Cherry Brook to a circular reservoir behind the buildings. Water was taken for four years without Duchy permission. Permission was quickly granted because the Prince Consort, Prince Albert, had encouraged the venture. Later, water was also leated from the East Dart River to the north end reservoir. The water was then leated to water wheels used for grinding and powering other machinery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The leat through the site is described in the book Industrial Archaeology of Dartmoor as now being dry and &amp;ldquo;two points at which it crosses the Cherry Brook, which flows between the buildings, can be seen. At one of these points, after feeding half the wheelhouses, the leat passes under the Cherry Brook through a wooden launder, which is still in place, in hard and excellent condition in spite of its years of saturation. Further downstream the leat&amp;rsquo;s channel back under the brook is of stone, big enough for a man to enter. The water had to be conveyed some way before being allowed to discharge, in order to prevent pollution of the Cherry Brook&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Waterwheels were used in the three massively-built incorporating mills (1,2,3 on the &lt;a class="link" href="map.jpg" >map&lt;/a>), glazing mill (4), pressing house (5) and two in the incorporating/composition mill and cartridge pressing house/corning/dusting house and glazing mill complex (6,7), and the final preparation rooms (8), making eight altogether. There is also a ninth, disused wheelpit at the final preparation rooms with later lean-tos in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Separate from the powder works to the south, along the road in, is the row of 19th century buildings that included cottages, a manager&amp;rsquo;s house, school, cooperage and a small Methodist chapel. Today, there is a pottery, offices and farm buildings. South of the cottages beside the road is the proving mortar and nearby is a wheel-binding stone, used for fixing hot iron rims to cart and wagon wheels.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The site - starting below at South Chimney after entering at the top of the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There can be confusion identifying buildings when referring to the 2019 book and the 1990 survey listed above. The book starts at the south end of the site (page 98) with &amp;ldquo;Building 1&amp;rdquo; and the archaeogical survey starts from the north. The survey numbers are in (brackets).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no known map saying what each building was used for, so there is conjecture based on the gunpowder-making processes and the requirements for them to be carried out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If ready-made charcoal was brought in, then the South Chimney could have been for processing saltpetre, dissolving it and recrystallising it to make it more pure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three phases of development and extension have been identified and it is likely that the function of the buildings changed over time. A flue and chimney indicate heat was involved. The flue to the chimney is about 1 metre deep and 1 metre wide. Its eastern portion is now open and rubble-filled, but the western portion is still capped. It enters the base of the chimney which is set on a plinth. The chimney is about 10.5 metres high.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Possibly a saltpetre crystallising house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Long rectangular single-storey building located at the southern end of the site and aligned north to south.. Two, possibly three, phases have been identified. Water was culverted through the building under the floor. Its north wall was probably the dwarf wall which now subdivides it from the extension to the north. Dwarf walls in one interior consist of one long spine wall and two side walls. Another dwarf wall runs east to west across the structure from the northernmost door to the east wall. These appear to form a raised floor with water, air or heat circulating beneath. A small, square, stone-lined feature to the west of the south-west corner may be a well, or possibly a pit in which staves were soaked. The building is described in the book as the Watch House, where materials in and out of the site were monitored. It might also have been used as a store.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Incorporating/composition mill (south), possible cartridge press house (south of N building) and possible corning/dusting house/glazing mill. Consists of two pairs of structures on either side of two wheelpits. The tailrace of the southern wheepit discharges back to the Cherrybrook. The wheel between the southern mill was powered by a continuation of the leat powering buildings to the north. The wheelpit tailrace discharged via a channel into Cherry Brook. The culvert has an arched roof of granite blocks overlain by slabs.&lt;/p>

The three incorporating mill houses (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) were of massive construction with many granite blocks being 6-feet long and the was about 6-feet thick, to withstand inadvertent explosions. The roofs were very flimsy, of wood and tar, to blow off without damaging the main structure. They could be replaced easily.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background: 5 (1) Incorporating Mill:&lt;/strong> Consists of a pair of gable-ended structures flanking a large central wheelpit. Both of massive granite blocks with walls about 2 metres thick at their bases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tar dribbles indicate original roofing was of tarred tarpaulin or wood. This was probably to allow any accidental explosion to go upwards and leave the walls standing, a technique still used by artisinal powder makers in India and China today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wheelpit is aligned north-east to south-west and runs the whole width of the units. Wheel axle appears to have projected into their ground floors. Powered by a launder to the north-east which flowed out through a culvert to the south-west. This is roofed for 3.5 - 4 metres, then becomes an open channel which runs downhill to feed the reservoir belonging to &amp;lsquo;Building 2&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The raised bank at the left brought the leat that fed a launder to the waterwheel.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This proving mortar is just off the road, on the left, on the last bend when driving in approaching the Pottery, cafe and mill cottages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It fired a (probably) 68 lb ball to test the powder. The distance travelled by the ball was a measure of the strength of the powder and undoubtedly a good sales tactic for potential buyers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This walk was reached from a small roadside layby marked by the yellow cross below the &amp;ldquo;Lich Way Plaque&amp;rdquo; label on the map. Normally, for a group, it would be reached from the main car park in Postbridge or the car park in the forest just across the road from it. There is also a car park at Higher Cherry Brook Bridge, marked with the P symbol and yellow cross on the map&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Please note that there is no parking available at the Powdermills Pottery and shop except when visiting them&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
