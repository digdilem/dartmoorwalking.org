&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a pleasant and fairly easy walk. The terrain is mostly forestry paths, with some small sections of open moorland. The paths may have small puddles, and mud or ruts if there&amp;rsquo;s forestry work underway, but are generally well maintained.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this walk was first published, Dartmoor National Park have created a circular walk that also takes in these ancient sites in Bellever. The details may be available from the Visitor Centre at the start, but the route may differ from ours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please keep dogs under control. Bellever woods are conservation grazed by Dartmoor Ponies, and sheep may be present in the early section just after the Clapper Bridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>When you&amp;rsquo;re ready to leave, leave the car park and walk down the road a short distance and take the path to the right to the Clapper Bridge&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Postbridge Clapper was likely built in the Medieval period, around the 13th Century, but may be older than this as it&amp;rsquo;s impossibly to date accurately. What&amp;rsquo;s clear is that it was built to provide a safe crossing for the packhorse routes needing to cross the river, with stout ponies carrying wool and agricultural goods and later, supplying the tin mining industry. Today, the village of Postbridge remains a central and important location on Dartmoor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are hundreds of Clapper Bridges on Dartmoor, which are the simplest of stone structures relying purely on gravity - no interlocking joints or mortar are used. Postbridge is unusual in that the slabs are particularly large and would have been difficult to position. Partly because of their size, the bridge has proved remarkably resistant to flood damage over the centuries and has mostly survived without change. However, you may notice iron bands that help secure it now. These date from around the Victorian period onwards, being replaced when necessary, and more modern repairs may show epoxy resin filled holes from the 1980s onwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most photographed bridges on Dartmoor and a very familiar sight to travellers.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just past the Oak Tree, using the road bridge in the picture above as a reference, there&amp;rsquo;s an old Mould stone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When tin ore was smelted at a blowing house, the tin was poured into mould stones to cool. These formed ingots of a specified shape and weight which were then carried off the moor to be sold. It&amp;rsquo;s not known why this stone is here - there&amp;rsquo;s no known blowing house nearby and they were too valuable to be easily discarded, but as we know this was a route travelled by tin miners, perhaps it fell unnoticed from a pack pony&amp;rsquo;s load.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bellever Forest was planted by the Duchy of Cornwall in 1921 to help replenish national wood supplies which were much depleted after the First World War.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bellever Complex is an internationally renowned archaelogical site, and forestry has obscured or damaged a large part of it.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Kraps ring is a Bronze Age settlement of around 9 stone hut circles within a partially enclosing perimeter wall of roughly 30 meters diameter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The name &amp;ldquo;Kraps&amp;rdquo; may derive from a local term meaning &amp;ldquo;Corpse&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Stone hut circles and hut settlements were the dwelling places of prehistoric farmers on Dartmoor. They mostly date from the Bronze Age, with the earliest examples on the Moor in this building tradition dating to about 1700 BC. The stone-based round houses consist of low walls or banks enclosing a circular floor area; remains of the turf or thatch roof are not preserved. The huts may occur singly or in small or large groups and may lie in the open or be enclosed by a bank of earth and stone. Although they are common on the Moor, their longevity and their relationship with other monument types provide important information on the diversity of social organisation and farming practices amongst prehistoric communities. They are particularly representative of their period and a substantial proportion of surviving examples are considered worthy of protection. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Historic England&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Heading Southwards, we cross the Lych Way at right angles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lych way is a medieval track starting from Bellever Village a short way to the East and continuing Westwards for around 10km, mostly across open moor, to Lydford Church. Church laws at the time forbade burial for this region except at that location, and the dead were carried there to be buried. There are several &amp;ldquo;Coffin stones&amp;rdquo; along the route where the coffin would be put whilst the bearers rested. The practice ceased in 1260 when the dead were allowed to be buried at Widicombe-in-the-Moor, although some still chose to be buried at Lydford.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even today, this route is associated strongly with supernatural happenings by some. The editor&amp;rsquo;s own mother once swerved to &amp;ldquo;avoid a coffin in the middle of the road&amp;rdquo; whilst driving alone at night.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This walk takes us up along a ridge taking in several tors, including one that was very important for the old Tin Mining Stannary laws. Then it drops into the West Dart River, exploring some Bronze Age Hut Circles and then back past Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood and down the valley back to the start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please note: In accordance with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/enjoy-dartmoor/places/wistmans-wood" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dartmoor National Park&amp;rsquo;s guidance&lt;/a>, please do not enter Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood itself, or disturb it in any way.&lt;/strong>
Sadly, due to huge numbers of visitors over recent years, significant damage has been caused even by those simply walking through it as well as those removing moss, branches or littering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If you just want to visit Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood, you can follow the path up from the given parking coordinates. This shortens the walk to about a mile each way and is a pleasant easy walk, although not accessible to wheelchairs. &lt;a class="link" href="#wistmans-wood" >Jump to Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Before we leave our parking space, take a moment to look at the sides of the quarry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This place is known as &amp;ldquo;Two Bridges Tor&amp;rdquo; as there is a distinct granite formation at the back which helps show how Tors on Dartmoor were formed, even when the Tor is underground. Rain water, being slightly acidic, soaks into the ground and rots the rock, primarily at cracks and weaknesses to form horizontal and vertical joints. Over a long period of time, the harder rock is left behind as the rest is changed into growan (Decomposed granite) and sand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We see this here as this quarry was dug to provide sand and gravel for road building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once exposed to the atmosphere, then weathering continues the early work of underground decay with with, rain and the freeze/thaw action of the winter to further attack the rock.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There seems to be a well repeated rumour that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from several people who are insistent that Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Tors were once volcanos. Sadly, this is completely untrue!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This imposing rock was chosen as the meeting place of Great Court of Devon Tinners dating from around at least 1300AD and possibly as far back as 1100. The court would meet here and establish tin laws, mete out punishments for breaches, pay taxes and distribute earnings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was also an impressive Chair made of slabs of granite with a tall back and overhang placed here by a granite table for court proceedings. The chair was moved to Dunnabridge Pound by a Mr Leaman using &amp;ldquo;12 yoke of oxen&amp;rdquo; - a team of 24 beasts - and it can be seen there today, just a few miles away.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Parliament Rock itself has a natural shelf which was used as a &amp;ldquo;Court Cryer&amp;rsquo;s Chair&amp;rdquo; - presumably to shout for order and repeat the findings of the court to the wider audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Stannary&amp;rdquo; comes from the latin name for tin, Stannum. It also gives it its periodic definition, &amp;lsquo;Sn&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before the fourth century, &amp;ldquo;Tin&amp;rdquo; was used to describe any alloy of silver and lead, rather than the metal Tin.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Between 1100 and 1650 AD, some 26,000 tons of smelted, white tin were extracted from Dartmoor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The most productive year was 1524 AD, when 252 tons of white tin were produced.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Stannary Court had considerable power and influence and controlled the metal mining industry of Dartmoor.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Down to the West and North of this tor is a very long rabbit bury (marked on the OS maps as &amp;ldquo;pillow mound&amp;rdquo;) that is part of Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Warren and is 108 metres long. There are over 30 mounds comprising the warre in this area, some barely noticable in the tussocky grass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sadly, these mounds they don&amp;rsquo;t photograph well, and just appear as lumpy brown areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pillow-mounds">Pillow Mounds
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pillow Mounds are man made rabbit warrens dating from at least the medieval period.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Their name comes from the pillow shape of the mounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>They were used to breed rabbits (Also known as Conies) for meat and fur. Rabbit was a mainstay of the local tin miners and was sometimes the only meat they would regularly eat.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Rabbit farming like this was done throughout Britain, and you can find many references to &amp;ldquo;Warren&amp;rdquo; in place names that persist today.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>You can continue walking up the valley for about 400m to a small copse as marked on our map. Just above this are the meager stone ruins of Warren House, where the rabbit breeder responsible for the creation and upkeep of these pillow mounds and their contents&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will probably have seen some of the many hut circles on this walk. There are known to be well over one hundred of them in the vicinity of Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood, so this was clearly a very busy place four thousand or so years ago.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Altogether a remarkable place, said by early antiquaries to be the home of the druids, supposing Wistman to be a corruption of “wise man”. But, quite aside from the reality that there is no evidence whatsoever to associate these white-bearded priests with Dartmoor, this supposed derivation of the name is incorrect. There are two more plausible explanations for the name, either that it is derived from Welshman’s Wood, “Welsh” or “Wealas” being the Saxon word for “foreigners”, or that it comes from the Devon word “wisht” meaning “haunted”. &amp;ndash;&lt;cite>Mike Brown (2001), Guide to Dartmoor&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Trees are mostly Pendunculate (or English) Oak &lt;em>Quercus Robur&lt;/em> and known to be hundreds of years old, and some Rowan &lt;em>Sorbus Aucuparia&lt;/em> mixed in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shaped by the climate, weather and ground conditions almost unique to this location, they have naturally grown dwarfed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>The name of Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood may derive from the dialect word &amp;ldquo;wisht&amp;rdquo;, meaning &amp;ldquo;eerie/uncanny&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;pixie-led/haunted&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>The legendary Wild Hunt in Devon, whose hellhounds are known as Yeth (Heath) or Wisht Hounds in the Devonshire dialect, is particularly associated with Wistman&amp;rsquo;s Wood.&lt;/li>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pub changed its name to Two Bridges Hotel some time prior to 1849, so pre-dates the modern road bridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saracen&amp;rsquo;s Head Inn: a booklet to mark its 225-year history records that &amp;ldquo;By 1772 the Turnpike bridge had been constructed across the Dart at Two Bridges and by 1794 Francis Buller had constructed the inn near the site. The inn bore the name of &lt;strong>The Saracen&amp;rsquo;s Head&lt;/strong>, a familiar name for pubs at the time but likely also connected to the fact that the Buller family crest was a Saracen&amp;rsquo;s head &amp;lsquo;affronte, couped, proper&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. Source: Alex Mettler (2015, rev.edn. 2018), Air Like Champagne: A short history of the Two Bridges Hotel, Dartmoor. Published by Two Bridges Hotel..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name &amp;ldquo;Two Bridges Hotel&amp;rdquo; seems to first appear after a change of landlord in May 1849 in an advertisement in the Western Morning News. In 1885, the name The Saracen&amp;rsquo;s Head Inn appeared in an advetisement to let including &amp;ldquo;that well known Inn House &amp;lsquo;The Saracen&amp;rsquo;s Head&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip;.. with buildings, stables, sheds and appurtenanes etc&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. The Two Bridges Inn was destroyed by fire in late May 1866, as reported in the Exeter Flying Post. The old name continued to be used for some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wentworth Buller, who cut the tree in 1868, was no doubt related to Sir Francis Buller, who had built the inn by 1794, some 74 years earlier? &lt;a class="link" href="https://boveytraceyhistory.org.uk/people/buller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>A web page about The Bullers of Bovey Tracy&lt;/a> mentions Capt. Thomas Wentworth Buller (1792-1852); Wentworth William Buller (1834-1883). There is &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Francis_Buller,_1st_Baronet#Moorland_improver" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>a Wikipedia entry for Sir Francis Buller&lt;/a> that includes &amp;ldquo;He also built an inn, named the Saracen&amp;rsquo;s Head after the Buller family&amp;rsquo;s crest, at Two Bridges, on a site now occupied by the Two Bridges Hotel.&amp;rdquo; This was citing: William Crossing (1902), A Hundred Years on Dartmoor, 5th edn, The Western Morning News Co.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warning&lt;/strong> This walk enters the Okehampton Military Training area. Before embarking, do check the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dartmoor-firing-programme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dartmoor Firing times&lt;/a> The road access to the area will be manned and blocked at these times by the camp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, you should not approach or touch and strange or metallic objects on this walk. It is common to spot such things, including live munitions and rounds, that have been left behind by the live firing training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you do encounter such an item, take a positional reading and report it to the Training Safety Officer (tel: 01837 657210), Okehampton Camp or the Police who will investigate and dispose of the item safely.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>This walk takes you onto the Okehampton Military Training area and passes the anti-tank weapon firing points, Command Post, Target Butts, an OS Trig point and Red-a-Ven Brook and visit the second highest point on Dartmoor, Yes Tor at 610meters, or 2,000 feet. (High Willhays, only a short distance further, holds the title at 619m, 2031 ft)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Three types of target built in 1901 - static, moving and disappearing. The camp became the HQ for the Army School of Gunnery in the summer months and thereby the county&amp;rsquo;s most important practise camp&lt;/p>
