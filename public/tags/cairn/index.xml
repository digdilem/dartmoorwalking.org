&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This short walk starts at the Highest Pub in Southern England and climbs the gentle hill behind it, visiting several ancient sites on the way such as the Kings&amp;rsquo; Oven to the impressive Hurston Stone Row. We then return along a low ridge to another cairn atop Water Hill, before dropping back down to the starting point. The views are impressive, and although never far from the road, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to lose sight of modernity and step back in time in one&amp;rsquo;s imagination to when this area was a thriving tin mining valley, or even further back to the bronze age when it was also busy with several nearby settlements.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This pub claims to be the most famous pub on Dartmoor and is certainly one of the most visited, especially on a Summer&amp;rsquo;s day. When the prison was working, visitors would often stop by here on their way to visit friends and relatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At 434m above sea level, it&amp;rsquo;s the highest pub in Southern England and the second highest overall. It claims to have kept its fire burning continuously since 1845, which must make for exciting work as the pub&amp;rsquo;s chimney sweep.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally named New House and built in 1751, it was then positioned on the opposite side of the road where the foundations can still be seen. In 1845, the pub was rebuilt and renamed to the &amp;ldquo;Moreton Inn&amp;rdquo; to serve the thriving tin mining industry that was literally on its doorstep, with Vitifer and Golden Dagger mines only a short distance downhill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shortly afterwards it was renamed to its present title for the Headland Warren that was built nearby to give the miners a steady supply of meat.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The letters WB are difficult to see now, occupying the upper six inches on the face of the stone. This is one of a series of 15 similar stones that mark the bounds of Headland Warren, where rabbits were bred to feed the miners. Warren House Inn is named after the warren. The &amp;ldquo;15&amp;rdquo; bound stones includes the large Bennet&amp;rsquo;s Cross, which stands tall and proud to the side of the road, also marked &amp;ldquo;WB&amp;rdquo;. The stones date from around 1780 &lt;cite> &amp;ndash; (Dave Brewer, 2002, Dartmoor Boundary Markers, pp. 265-268)&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Benet’s Cross stands at the roadside, a tall roughly hewn cross with a distinctive bend in the shaft, inscribed on its north face the letters ‘WB’. The original purpose of the cross is uncertain — it may have been a route guide post, or a bond mark of lands owned by Buckfast Abbey, or perhaps both. The name should be spelt with a single ‘n’ and a single ‘t’ — though few people seem to do so — for it is derived from the Benedictine order of monks, indicating its former association with the original monastery at Buckfast — this was at first a Benedictine abbey, as also is the present one, but was a Cistercian monastery from the thirteenth century until the Dissolution. The cross also acted not only as a boundary marker for Headland Warren, to which the letters refer (WB = Warren Bounds), but also for the Vitifer and Birch Tor mining setts, as well as being a bond mark on the Chagford/North Bovey parish line, a purpose which it still serves today. A curious coincidence is the fact that a William Bennett was a representative of Chagford Stannary in the time of King Henry VIII, and he would have undoubtedly had some indirect connections with the earliest tin-streaming activities in the area.&amp;rdquo; &lt;cite>&amp;mdash; Mike Brown (2001) Guide to Dartmoor&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>This green cast iron item is a Telegraph Marker. There are thirteen of these items between Moretonhampstead and Tavistock. They marked the route of underground telegraph cables placed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After bad blizzards of 1891, a need was seen to create more reliable communications after overhead telegraph cables were damaged and made inoperable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The start of the walk is an ancient trackway to the open workings of the Water Hill Mine that has extensive diggings on this hillside. There is a large gert (A mining remain where tin was washed out of the rock) right behind the Warren House Inn that approaches from the west - this being the direction of the Caroline Mine. The Water Hill MIne workings extend rightwards in this photograph, towards Moretonhampstead, towards the workings of Bushdown Mine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s mysteries, the V stones - no-one knows what these are. It has been suggested they might be for the base of machinery, the base of a flagpole, a mould and I&amp;rsquo;m sure, many other things. (See plan below for location)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Two theories:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The DTRG (Dartmoor Tinworking Research Group) Newsletter May 2020 No. 58 has a note on the &amp;ldquo;Kings Oven Stones&amp;rdquo; by Nick Walter on pages 9-10 that proposes a possible function for these stones. They could have been supports for a hand windlass that could have been used for raising loads from a small shaft in the nearby mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The next issue of the same DTRG Newsletter, dated November 2020 No. 59, has a note on the &amp;ldquo;Kings Oven Stones&amp;rdquo; by Tom Greaves on page 19. The stones may have derived from a single stone that is now broken. The cut recesses could have housed the base (wood or metal) of a flagpole. They are situated near the foundations of the larger of two ruined buildings which might have been the mine office. It is recorded that at least one mine in this area flew such a flag when they were actively working.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>King&amp;rsquo;s Oven or Furnum Regis (in Latin). This derives from the fact that this is thought to be the site of an early smelting house, hence &amp;ldquo;oven&amp;rdquo;, the produce of which would be taxed by the King via the stannary towns, such as Chagford. Furnum Regis appears in the 1240 Perambulation of Dartmoor, although more likely mistaken for the landmark cairn at the summit of Water Hill.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Description: &amp;ldquo;The enclosure at King&amp;rsquo;s Oven is probably the site of medieval tin mining activities. Burnard comments that &amp;rsquo;the enclosure is circular and an acre in extent&amp;rsquo;. Burnard notes that the stone &amp;rsquo;looks something like the nether stone of a crazing mill&amp;rsquo;. A nether stone is the lower stone of a rotary crazing mill that was used for grinding tin ore. Crazing mills could only grind the alluvial gravels and they were replaced by stamping mills when coarser ores started being mined. In Newman&amp;rsquo;s //Dartmoor Tin Industry Field Guide// he states that only three crazing mills are known on Dartmoor at Sheepstor, Outcombe and Gobbet. Perhaps the stone photographed by Burnard in 1888 is evidence for a fourth crazing mill but the stone is no longer in situ today. King&amp;rsquo;s Oven was previously known as Furnum Regis and was mentioned by this name in a Perambulation of Henry III in 1240. However by 1609 in the Dartmoor Forestry Survey the location was known as King&amp;rsquo;s Oven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The fact that Furnum Regis, the King&amp;rsquo;s Oven (taken to imply a smelting place for tin), is a landmark in the 1240 Perambulation shows that tin was important as far back as the 1200s. The diggings in the area must date from that period - 800 years ago!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Somewhere in this area is a &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; cairn described by J. Butler (1991), Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities. The cairn was discovered and excavated by the Dartmoor Exploration Committee in 1900 and then it was &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; again, shortly afterwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During investigations on the cairn by Baring Gould, a &amp;ldquo;stone axe and a cinerary urn&amp;rdquo; (the latter upturned and covering a small heap of cremated bones on a flat stone, covered by a slab) were found. A photo of the restored Middle Bronze Age urn (1500-1000 BC) can be seen &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/Images3/Hurstone.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here (Credit: Legendary Dartmoor)&lt;/a> The pattern around the rim is believed made by impressing the clay with a twisted cord. It was restored 1960-1962 and was put on display in the Plymouth Museum.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>It is assumed that this landmark cairn, which is visible for some distance, is the &amp;ldquo;Furnum Regis&amp;rdquo; mentioned in the 1240 Perambulation of Dartmoor. This was occasioned by order of King Henry III when he granted the lands of the Forest of Dartmoor to his brother Richard. It was decreed that the Sheriff of Devon should do this accompanied by twelve knights and their attendants. Richard became an Earl in 1225 and was known as Richard of Cornwall (died 1272, aged 63)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Legend records that there are four fields, each one shaped for the suites of a pack of cards. A young tin mining wastrel, name of Jan Reynolds, dared to play cards during a church sermon. The Devil descended and bore Jan away on his large and fierce black horse, never to be seen again. As he was borne away, Jan dropped his cards, forming these enclosures. (Full story at the link below)&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>The less prosaic reality is that they were farming enclosures used to grow vegetables for the nearby mines.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Cadover Bridge is a popular riverside spot and within easy distance of Plymouth so attracts a lot of visitors on nice days. Many won&amp;rsquo;t be aware of the rich history surrounding the area, and the peace and quiet that can be had just a few minutes walking away from the road. Our walk takes you over Wigford Down to The Dewerstone with its commanding views. We visit a Bronze Age Walled Enclosure, hut circles, cairns, a neolithic wall, rock inscriptions and many other items of interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>From the car park, head towards the bridge and cross over, turning left when you can towards Cadover Cross&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cadover Bridge was known as Cadworthy Bridge in the 1840 Meavy Tithe Map. The nearby farm is Lower Cadworthy Farm where &amp;ldquo;worthy&amp;rdquo; is from the Saxon &amp;ldquo;worthig&amp;rdquo; meaning a one-family smallholding and &amp;ldquo;Cad&amp;rdquo; being a local word for the River Plym. Cad is also a Celtic word meaning conflict or strife, but it&amp;rsquo;s thought the former is the more accurate meaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In the charter of Isabella de Fortibus, 1291, the river is called Plymma from its source downward, and the confluence is thus referred to, &amp;ldquo;locum ubi Mewy cadit in Plymma&amp;rdquo;. The bridge, probably then a clapper, is called in the same charter &amp;ldquo;ponte de Cadaworth.&amp;rdquo; This name is taken from the Saxon worthig close by now called Cadworthy, and which was apparently formed on the site of a British battle - cad being a Celtic word meaning conflict or strife.&amp;rdquo; &lt;cite> &amp;ndash; William Crossing, 1912&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Also known as Wigford Down Cross. In 1873 the original section of the cross was found lying flat on the ground by a group of soldiers who were on an exercise from their camp on Ringmoor Down and, working with the then Vicar of Shaugh Prior, re-erected the cross.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By 1901 the cross had fallen again, and in 1915 a subsequent vicar arranged its restoration, including a new shaft:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In seeking a more secure site in which to erect the cross, he came across a green sward in the heather which he thought would make an ideal spot. Whilst digging a hole in the ground for the cross, he came across a large granite boulder which turned out to be the original socket stone for the cross, still in situ. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Dartmoor Crosses&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This tall cross is a waymarker on the Monastic Way between Priory and Tavistock Abbey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The medieval track ran from Plympton to Stony Cross aka Shaden Moor Cross, which is near the summit of Shaugh Moor on the Plympton-Cadover road, following the line of the modern road to near Cadover Bridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Close to the modern bridge was a ford, Cad-a-ford, (ford over the Cad) perhaps fifty-metres upstream. From here the track would go straight uphill from the ford to Marchant&amp;rsquo;s Cross, for Meavy. A sidebranch turned left for Wigford Down, up past Cadaford Cross as an alternative route over the Down.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are perhaps eight of these &amp;ldquo;L stones&amp;rdquo; running across Wigford Down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are boundary stones between the lands of Sir Ralph Lopes (of Maristow Estate to the north-east) and Mr Scobell (holding enclosed land at Urgles / Goodameavy, to the south-west), settled after a meeting on the Down as described in a letter by the Maristow steward and land agent George Giles.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>On 18th February 1841, George Giles, the steward and land agent of the Maristow-owned manors, wrote to a land surveyor by the name of William J Stentaford, thus: &amp;ldquo;I have been with Sir Ralph Lopes &amp;amp; Mr Scobell on Wigford Down this day they both returned to my office &amp;hellip; and ultimately agreed on an equal division of the 393a 3r 15p, the boundary to be shown by Granite posts, when the line has been traced — and that Mr Scobell’s portion shall be that moiety next adjoining his inclosed lands of Urgles and Good-a-Meavy beginning north from the corner of outher Diamond park &amp;hellip; across towards Oxen Torr — or somewhere in that direction, wherever the line of equal division may fall &amp;hellip; the line &amp;hellip; must be taken up from Sir Trayton Drake’s boundary of Greenwell Down — and should it fall upon Shaugh Prior Boundary it must not be carried across it &amp;hellip; This is a matter that requires your earliest attention. Sir Ralph and Mr Scobell will again meet on the locus in quo when you are prepared to shew the divisional line. This Job is to be at the joint expense of each party.&amp;rdquo; &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Mike Brown &lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Ralph Lopes (1788-1854) was MP for Westbury, a pocket borough controlled by his uncle, Manesseh Masseh Lopes, until his uncle&amp;rsquo;s death in 1831.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>He then inherited his uncle&amp;rsquo;s Baronetcy and his estate of Maristow - and the right to nominate future MPs at Westbury. A right removed in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reform_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Reform Act 1832&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In 1841 there was a boundary disagreement between Lopes and his neighbour, Mr Scobell, which culminated with them formally reaching an agreeing on where their lands met. A formal letter was drawn up and these stones were placed to mark the boundary.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The above image might help make sense of the various features that you encounter as you cross the down towards the Summit Cairns.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These two cairns would have been much more imposing once, but they have been robbed for road building over the centuries. The near one was almost completely removed, leaving a depression caused by the weight of the stones above it. This formed a dew pond which has deepened as livestock erodes it in the search for water.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are remains of five summit cairns in this vicinity, all of which have been damaged in various ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one was once an Observation Post during World War 2, and remains of the concrete which topped it may still be seen.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So what does BA mean? Unlike many marked stones on Dartmoor, that&amp;rsquo;s not clear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Possibilities are &amp;ldquo;Buckland Abbey&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Brisworthy Arrishes&amp;rdquo; (Arrishes means Fields) - or something else entirely.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Called a Kerbed Ring Cairn because the inner circle has a &amp;lsquo;kerb&amp;rsquo; of 6.3m diameter to mark its position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the Ordnance Survey maps have marked this as a kistvaen, there is no evidence of a kist or grave here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A dry leat runs left to right at the front of this picture which would have been used to run water for clay works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was once a water wheel in the central area between the two largest lakes where a wheelpit can still be seen. It was built between 1886 and 1904.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lakes are now managed and fished by the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gethooked.co.uk/fishing-venue/358/plymouth-and-district-angling-club" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
