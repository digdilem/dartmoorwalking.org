&lt;p>The name Widecombe is from &amp;ldquo;Withy or Willow Valley&amp;rdquo;, a Saxon name. Settlements and a wooden church were established here long before the Normans invaded in 1066 and in the Domesday Book (of 1086) includes the manors of Natsworthy and Dunstone in the Webburn valley. Granite longhouses began to appear in the 1100 &amp;amp; 1200s as the Village grew and got richer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The large Granite Village Sign depicts the Uncle Tom Cobley song in a carved inset at the top. This sign was designed by Lady Sylvia Sayer in the 1940s who was chair of the Dartmoor Preservation Association from 1851 to 1973.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Lady Sayer was still a tremendous force on Dartmoor into the late 1980s. Respected, and perhaps a little feared, by the staff at Dartmoor National Park Authority when I worked there &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Simon&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

>by the Puritans&lt;/a> who sought to rid the Church of England of what they considered to be Roman Catholic practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It then became a &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poorhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Poorhouse&lt;/a> then in Victorian Times, a School. Currently it is owned by The National Trust and a shop and craft centre.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A rare gravestone memorial in Widecombe churchyard, with two names for the same person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Olive Katharine Parr was the author who used the pen name, Beatrice Chase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Olive Parr, 1874 – 1955, moved to nearby Venton in the early 1900s and there wrote many books including &amp;ldquo;Through a Dartmoor Window&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somewhat of a self-publicist, Olive gave herself the rather grand title of &amp;ldquo;My Lady of the Moor&amp;rdquo;, claims to have invented the Uncle Tom Cobley story, and said she started the tradition of leaving fresh flowers on the grave of Kitty Jay. However, her descriptions of Dartmoor Life during the early twentieth century are without doubt very important from a historical perspective, and her passion for Dartmoor was no lie. She was also involved in the First World War effort, creating the &amp;ldquo;Knights of the White Crusade&amp;rdquo; - a movement to encourage all servicemen to be &amp;ldquo;Pure and noble&amp;rdquo;. She also campaigned against Dartmoor being turned into a National Park, and against its use as a Military training ground. Clearly a lady of strong opinions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dominating the village is the medieval &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Saint_Pancras,_Widecombe-in-the-Moor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Church of St. Pancras&lt;/a> which dates from the late 1300, although there is a list of vicars which goes back to 1253 for the Village. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes called The Cathedral Of The Moor due to it being so imposing, and also as it&amp;rsquo;s the biggest Church on Dartmoor. The 120ft tower was added in the 1400 or early 1500&amp;rsquo;s through the benevolence of the tinners&amp;rsquo; Guild of St Pancras.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Named after a Roman boy, Pancratius, martyred under Emperor Diocletian in 304 AD.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thornhill or Thorny Lanewas a medieval road going North from Hemsworthy Gate to Natsworthy that avoided going down the steep Widecombe Hill. This is still legally classified as a full motorable road (A Byway Open to All Traffic - or BOAT), and is legally used by cars and motorbikes today although, as you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s more suited to off road vehicles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Middle Bonehill was owned by the Smerdon family throughout almost the entire post-medieval period. In fact, it was owned from mid-Elizabethan times until the closing years of the Victorian era by no less than eleven consecutive generations of John Smerdons.
The last John Smerdon died and the property passed to Edwin Smerdon who died in 1900, when the family connection was finished. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; Mike Brown&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

An early nineteenth century barn stands alongside, whilst a seventeenth century barn stands on the opposite side of the road. Lower Bonehill is another sixteenth century longhouse, in the middle of a group of five seventeenth and eighteenth century outbuildings.

&lt;p>There was no lease following this, so it must be concluded the venture was unsuccessful. In 1846, another license was issued to other adventurers!&lt;/p>

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princetown_Railway0&lt;/a> (using steam locomotives) that replaced it, runnning from Yelverton to Princetown.&lt;/p>

>South Devon and Tavistock Railway Company (SD&amp;amp;TR) Plymouth-Tavistock line&lt;/a>. It was adopted by the GWR from 1st January 1922 and closed March 3rd, 1956.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The horse-drawn tramway consisted of short wagons that could be pulled in quite a tight turn. The line enters this image at the far right, from the gateway seen above, swings around a hairpin bend (kindly marked by the sheep) and doubles back towards the camera at the left, from where it goes through the first gate above up to Iron Mine Lane and on to Princetown via the west side of the Down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steam railway could not turn a tight bend like this and was built running into this image at the bottom left and on into the distance towards the reservoir where it ran around the flank of the Down above the dam to Burrator &amp;amp; Sheepstor Halt and then on to Princetown, travelling up the east side of the Down.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This grass triangle is no burial place - it is a triangular piece of land that was left so that a horse and cart could negotiate a fork in the road where three lanes meet; or maybe it built up from these cart and wagon turnings over the centuries: this is called a godcake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The so-called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Godcake" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This walk starts near the famous Warren House Inn and descends into the Redwater valley, home to many ancient tin workings and four distinct tin mines which were combined in 1845. This was a major industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries employing hundreds of people, and many ruins and reminders remain. The main route is firm and easy going, with a gentle hill on the final climb back to the car park.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: The track along the valley, although firm underfoot, is often very wet all year round. Sensible footwear recommended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do feel free to explore the area and leave our track - there are many points of interest, some of which we&amp;rsquo;ve marked on the map and all are worth exploring.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the parking, on a clear day, you can see three rock walled enclosures across the valley. Together with a fourth (see map, central), these are known as the &amp;ldquo;Four Aces&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Playing Cards&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Legend tells&amp;hellip;
Jan Reynolds was a tin miner from Widecombe who was more interested in drinking and gambling than in going to church on a Sunday. Finding himself short of money he made a deal with the Devil: in return for money to fund his gambling the Devil could have his soul if he was found asleep in church.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jan soon forgot the pact and one Sunday he fell asleep while playing cards in church. There was a sound of horses’ hooves outside, and a flash of lightning so fierce that it tore off the top of the church tower, then the Devil strode into the church and snatched up the terrified miner, carrying him up into the sky and across the moor. Jan had four aces in his hand and he dropped them in what is now known as the Aces Field.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>One can quite clearly see a diamond shape, but it taxes the imagination to see the shape of a Heart, a Club and a Spade in these fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reality of these enclosures is that they were either to keep rabbits in or rabbits out. The farm just over the hill to the Easy is Headland Warren Farm, which was known to breed rabbits which formed a large part of the miner&amp;rsquo;s diet. I&amp;rsquo;m unclear whether the rabbits were kept in these enclosures, or they were built for growing crops which needed protecting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Take the path Eastwards into the valley for about half a mile&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="vitifer-mine">Vitifer Mine

&lt;p>This area contains the remains of four distinct mines:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Vitifer (Prev: Vytifer) Mine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Birch Tor Mine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy Birch Tor Mine (AKA Headland Mine)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Golden Dagger Mine.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Vitifer and Birch Tor were separate mines originally, then combined, then separated, and then combined again. Naming of these two seems interchangeable, with both workings being known by both names.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A fireplace or boiler would have been placed at the far end of the flue, and the smoke run through it to the chimney, which released it high enough not to bother those at ground level.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This mine was named after a bronze dagger was found here from the early men who lived here four thousand years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dagger was taken to Plymouth Museum, and rumoured to have been destroyed during World War 2 bombing of that building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A replica dagger is owned by DNPA and can sometimes be seen at their information centres and displays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This area was mined for Tin from at least the fifteenth century via surface streaming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mines were dug to chase tin further underground from around the 1750s. Given the amount of surface water in this area, one imagines these were very wet mines and hard to keep dewatered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The underground workings ended in 1914 when many men were drafted for the First World War. Some surface working remained until 1939 when again, the needs of war took labour away from the moors.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A buddle is a simple structure to separate material out by its density.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fine sediment is introduced at the centre point by trough or pipe in suspension with water. As it flows towards the outer edge, heavier material is deposited first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some buddles are assisted by rotary brushes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once sufficient sediment has built up, it is shovelled out with the &amp;ldquo;headings&amp;rdquo; containing the more valuable minerals in the centre, and the less valuable or waste known as &amp;ldquo;tailings&amp;rdquo; towards the edge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one is known to have been fed by a slurry onto the cone by a small leat arrangement and swept by a waterwheel-driven &amp;ldquo;wood and rags sweeps&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;em>Note from Simon: My mother once drove this road alone at night in the 1980s and swears she saw a coffin lying in her path. She swerved and avoided it, but didn&amp;rsquo;t dare return to investigate. I know of no other reports of coffins on this road but the incident was very close to the ancient Lich Way of which she wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware at the time.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="about-the-lich-way">About the Lich Way
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Lich Way is a 17 mile path across Dartmoor from beyond Bellever through to Lydford.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We join it on our way to the Powdermills for only a short distance, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting piece of Ancient Dartmoor history.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prior to 1260, residents of the farms and villages in this area of Dartmoor belonged to the Parish of Lydford. This meant that as well as travelling off the moor to attend services, they were expected to bury their dead in the consecrated ground of Lydford, then a major and powerful town. Coffins were carried by ox or pony cart, strapped directly onto pack ponies, or carried by men.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The route bears many memories of its purpose. There is a Coffin Wood, and many suitable large flat rocks along the route are identified as &amp;ldquo;Coffin Stones&amp;rdquo; where the heavy burden was laid so the carriers could rest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lich or Lych? Both methods of spelling are in wide usage, both on Dartmoor and elsewhere. The word is thought to be derived from the German &amp;ldquo;leich&amp;rdquo; or Dutch &amp;ldquo;lijk&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Corpse&amp;rdquo;, so perhaps Lich is the more correct.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For more information about the Lich way, please see the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/2016/03/17/lych_way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="about-gunpowder">About Gunpowder
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Gunpowder is a mixture of three components of varying proportions depending on intended use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder#Composition_and_characteristics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>More info - Wikipedia&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the production of gunpowder is complicated and is unsurprisingly dangerous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Powdermills site is also complicated. Everything (except for the water) entered the site at the Southern entrance. Various stages in production occurred going up through the site to the three incorporation mills at the north end and then coming back down through the site until final storage in a main magazine ready for shipment to buyers.&lt;/p>

loading="lazy"
alt="This DNPA Notice on the first Incorporation Mill explains the process"
class="gallery-image"
data-flex-grow="177"
data-flex-basis="426px"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gunpowder, black powder or rock powder (local name) used for quarrying and mine blasting, is still used in fireworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The composition is 75% saltpetre, 15% charcoal and 10% sulphur (aka brimstone or burning stone).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dynamite, more powerful, was patented in May 1867 by Alfred Nobel. Its success as a superior explosive led to eventual closure of the mills in 1897.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ingredients, saltpetre (mostly from India), sulphur (mostly from the Vesuvius and Stromboli regions of Italy) and the charcoal (made from local wood, especially alder or alder buckthorn), were ground separately in a grinding mill house. These were then blended in the required proportions in large barrels tumbled by waterwheels. This incorporated them into a single compound using a combination of mixing, crushing and churning. This was a hazardous process that was governed by strict regulations and regular inspections. Only wooden and copper tools were allowed , so as to prevent sparks causing explosions. The men had to wear leather aprons and sof-soled shoes, no hobnail boots. There is a story that one man, Silas Sleep, who took his breakfast and dinner to eat at work, always ate them both together, in case he was &amp;lsquo;blowed up&amp;rsquo; and sent to meet his maker before lunch time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Incorporation&amp;rdquo; was the first stage of production, in one of the three incorporation mills (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) at the top of the site, it resulted in a form of &amp;ldquo;cake&amp;rdquo;. It was probably at this stage that the powders were dampened with water to reduce &amp;ldquo;dust&amp;rdquo; and prevent accidental explosions. This also helped the very soluble salpetre to mix into the porous charcoal. The resulting damp paste or &amp;ldquo;mill cake&amp;rdquo; was shaped into &amp;ldquo;corns&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was &amp;ldquo;ripe charge&amp;rdquo; that could be stored for a short period. It was then pressed down in e.g. a 2-ft square box to &amp;ldquo;press cake&amp;rdquo; about an inch thick. Originally this was a hand-powered process, like a cider press, but later a water wheel was used to drive the presses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next stage was &amp;ldquo;corning&amp;rdquo; when slabs of cake were broken up with wooden mallets into a granular form. Later, water-powered machines were used. This involved rollers and then sieving through different sized meshes. The powder was then tumbled in rotating barrels or cylinders. These were covered with gauze to collect any small dust-sized particles. This was another water-wheel powered process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next stage was &amp;ldquo;glazing&amp;rdquo;, where the grains were tumbled again, with graphite or black lead to give each grain of powder a waterproof coating. This made the powder suitabe for use in damp mines and quarrying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last stage was &amp;ldquo;drying&amp;rdquo;, sometimes in the open air. Usually, this was done in heated &amp;ldquo;Gloom stoves&amp;rdquo;. These were heated by an iron furnace with the powder laid on trays stacked around it. Later, steam stoves were used to heat pipes near the trays. The process used a flue to take away any sparks and fumes to a chimney - and this is seen at the south, bottom end of the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final product was packed in large oak barrels that were covered with leather to prevent spillage and from stray sparks entering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The gunpowder quality was tested periodically using the proving mortar that lies beside the road going into the Powdermills site. The strength was determined by firing a 68 lb iron ball over a distance that was then measured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the actual gunpowder makers or millers, the Powdermills employed coopers, blacksmiths, carpenters, wagoneers, carters, wheelwrights, stable staff and labourers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-powdermills-history">The Powdermills History
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;strong>George Frean&lt;/strong>, a Plymouth Alderman, founded the Plymouth &amp;amp; Dartmoor Gunpowder Company and opened Powdermills in 1844; it closed in 1897. It had employed about 100 men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>George Frean later teamed up with James Peek, one of three brothers importing tea - wanted a biscuit business for &amp;ldquo;tea and biscuits&amp;rdquo; - wrote to George Frean, &amp;ldquo;miller and ships biscuit maker&amp;rdquo;, who had married a niece of theirs, to manage &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peek_Freans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Peak Freans&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole complex was powered by water which was brought in by three leats. Initially, one leat came from the east bank of the Cherry Brook to a rectangular reservoir north of the three isolated incorporating mills. The water then returned to the Cherry Brook. The second leat came from the west side of the Cherry Brook to a circular reservoir behind the buildings. Water was taken for four years without Duchy permission. Permission was quickly granted because the Prince Consort, Prince Albert, had encouraged the venture. Later, water was also leated from the East Dart River to the north end reservoir. The water was then leated to water wheels used for grinding and powering other machinery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The leat through the site is described in the book Industrial Archaeology of Dartmoor as now being dry and &amp;ldquo;two points at which it crosses the Cherry Brook, which flows between the buildings, can be seen. At one of these points, after feeding half the wheelhouses, the leat passes under the Cherry Brook through a wooden launder, which is still in place, in hard and excellent condition in spite of its years of saturation. Further downstream the leat&amp;rsquo;s channel back under the brook is of stone, big enough for a man to enter. The water had to be conveyed some way before being allowed to discharge, in order to prevent pollution of the Cherry Brook&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Waterwheels were used in the three massively-built incorporating mills (1,2,3 on the &lt;a class="link" href="map.jpg" >map&lt;/a>), glazing mill (4), pressing house (5) and two in the incorporating/composition mill and cartridge pressing house/corning/dusting house and glazing mill complex (6,7), and the final preparation rooms (8), making eight altogether. There is also a ninth, disused wheelpit at the final preparation rooms with later lean-tos in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Separate from the powder works to the south, along the road in, is the row of 19th century buildings that included cottages, a manager&amp;rsquo;s house, school, cooperage and a small Methodist chapel. Today, there is a pottery, offices and farm buildings. South of the cottages beside the road is the proving mortar and nearby is a wheel-binding stone, used for fixing hot iron rims to cart and wagon wheels.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There can be confusion identifying buildings when referring to the 2019 book and the 1990 survey listed above. The book starts at the south end of the site (page 98) with &amp;ldquo;Building 1&amp;rdquo; and the archaeogical survey starts from the north. The survey numbers are in (brackets).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no known map saying what each building was used for, so there is conjecture based on the gunpowder-making processes and the requirements for them to be carried out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If ready-made charcoal was brought in, then the South Chimney could have been for processing saltpetre, dissolving it and recrystallising it to make it more pure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three phases of development and extension have been identified and it is likely that the function of the buildings changed over time. A flue and chimney indicate heat was involved. The flue to the chimney is about 1 metre deep and 1 metre wide. Its eastern portion is now open and rubble-filled, but the western portion is still capped. It enters the base of the chimney which is set on a plinth. The chimney is about 10.5 metres high.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Possibly a saltpetre crystallising house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Long rectangular single-storey building located at the southern end of the site and aligned north to south.. Two, possibly three, phases have been identified. Water was culverted through the building under the floor. Its north wall was probably the dwarf wall which now subdivides it from the extension to the north. Dwarf walls in one interior consist of one long spine wall and two side walls. Another dwarf wall runs east to west across the structure from the northernmost door to the east wall. These appear to form a raised floor with water, air or heat circulating beneath. A small, square, stone-lined feature to the west of the south-west corner may be a well, or possibly a pit in which staves were soaked. The building is described in the book as the Watch House, where materials in and out of the site were monitored. It might also have been used as a store.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Incorporating/composition mill (south), possible cartridge press house (south of N building) and possible corning/dusting house/glazing mill. Consists of two pairs of structures on either side of two wheelpits. The tailrace of the southern wheepit discharges back to the Cherrybrook. The wheel between the southern mill was powered by a continuation of the leat powering buildings to the north. The wheelpit tailrace discharged via a channel into Cherry Brook. The culvert has an arched roof of granite blocks overlain by slabs.&lt;/p>

The three incorporating mill houses (&amp;ldquo;wheelhouses&amp;rdquo;) were of massive construction with many granite blocks being 6-feet long and the was about 6-feet thick, to withstand inadvertent explosions. The roofs were very flimsy, of wood and tar, to blow off without damaging the main structure. They could be replaced easily.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background: 5 (1) Incorporating Mill:&lt;/strong> Consists of a pair of gable-ended structures flanking a large central wheelpit. Both of massive granite blocks with walls about 2 metres thick at their bases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tar dribbles indicate original roofing was of tarred tarpaulin or wood. This was probably to allow any accidental explosion to go upwards and leave the walls standing, a technique still used by artisinal powder makers in India and China today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wheelpit is aligned north-east to south-west and runs the whole width of the units. Wheel axle appears to have projected into their ground floors. Powered by a launder to the north-east which flowed out through a culvert to the south-west. This is roofed for 3.5 - 4 metres, then becomes an open channel which runs downhill to feed the reservoir belonging to &amp;lsquo;Building 2&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The raised bank at the left brought the leat that fed a launder to the waterwheel.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This proving mortar is just off the road, on the left, on the last bend when driving in approaching the Pottery, cafe and mill cottages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It fired a (probably) 68 lb ball to test the powder. The distance travelled by the ball was a measure of the strength of the powder and undoubtedly a good sales tactic for potential buyers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This walk was reached from a small roadside layby marked by the yellow cross below the &amp;ldquo;Lich Way Plaque&amp;rdquo; label on the map. Normally, for a group, it would be reached from the main car park in Postbridge or the car park in the forest just across the road from it. There is also a car park at Higher Cherry Brook Bridge, marked with the P symbol and yellow cross on the map&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Please note that there is no parking available at the Powdermills Pottery and shop except when visiting them&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hound Tor, Bowerman's Nose, Kitty Jay's Grave</title><link>https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/hound-tor-bowermans-nose-kitty-jays-grave/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/hound-tor-bowermans-nose-kitty-jays-grave/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://dartmoorwalking.org/p/hound-tor-bowermans-nose-kitty-jays-grave/14.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Hound Tor, Bowerman's Nose, Kitty Jay's Grave" />&lt;h2 id="information">Information

&lt;p>The tor is on Houndtor Down which, while it is unenclosed and freely open to the public, is owned by three families and is not common land. But then, all land on Dartmoor is owned by someone, whether it is Common Land or not. Hound Tor is clearly an &amp;ldquo;avenue tor&amp;rdquo;, where the central portion has been eroded to leave a central avenue running between the remaining piles - other examples are Bellever Tor, Haytor, Rippon Tor and Pew Tor. In fact, there are several avenues through Hound Tor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The road through Swallerton Gate leads to Swine Down and, further on, to Kitty Jay&amp;rsquo;s grave. An old gate post can be seen on the left (see next photograph). Beyond, there is a cottage on the left, Swallerton Gate, formerly the Hound Tor Inn until 1840 and thought before that to have been the Green Dragon Inn. It was recorded as Swine Down Cottage in the 1851 Census (Source: Mike Brown, 7389 7915 and 737 796).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is well-situated on the road between Ashburton and Chagford - two busy market towns. It would also have been used by the inhabitants of Widecombe and Ilsington on their way to market. There is an old cross in the garden wall of the cottage. Source: Dave Brewer (2002), Dartmoor Boundary Markers, Halsgrove, p. 115.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are records that Thor Heyerdahl wrote at least part of The Kon-Tiki Expedition in the cottage.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cross was going to be used in the hardcore for the floor of the extension but an intervention pointed out that is was a medieval cross head. The intervention came from a passing Harry Starkey, a well-known Dartmoor guide to whom there is a memorial locally on the back of the replaced Duke Stone on the Ilsington Manor boundary at SX 74605 77305, close to Becka Brook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This could be the cross formerly known as Swine Path Cross, at what is now known as Swallerton Gate, that is mentioned in a description of the boundary between Chagford and Ashburton Stannaries that dates from the last meeting of a Stannary Court in 1786 at Crockern Tor, using a &amp;ldquo;Presentiments of the Bounds of the several Stannary Courts of Devon&amp;rdquo; dated 1613 (Brewer, pp.269-273).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Addendum: FH (Harry) Starkey (1987) Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s Crosses and Some Ancient Tracks, Revised Edition, pages 155-156, records that the cross was found in a nearby hedge in 1939 and was described by EN Masson Phillips in Transactions of the Devonshire Association, Vol. LX11 (1940) page 267.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is said that the local parishes of Manaton, Widecombe-in-the-Moor and North Bovey all refused to bury poor Kitty&amp;rsquo;s body in consecrated ground because she had commited suicide. In those times this was considered to be self-murder and therefore a mortal sin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is also said that burial at crossroads was chosen possibly as a warning to others and also to confuse the spirit or ghost of the departed so that they might not easily find their way back to where they had lived and be of nuisance to the living.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Burial of Suicide Act 1823 did away with the requirement for crossroads burials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Addendum: Devon &amp;amp; Dartmoor Historic Environment Record - MDV7489 Jay&amp;rsquo;s Grave - one report in this record (by Beeson M, 2018) mentions Ann Jay, Kay, Betty Kay, an 1882 poem referring to Kay&amp;rsquo;s Grave, and Betsy Kay. An eyewitness to the exhumation put her death to around 1780-1790.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Who was Kitty Jay?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her name has been recorded as Ann Jay (1851), Kay (an old woman, 1876), Betty Kay (1881), Kitty Jay (Crossing, Guide to Dartmoor, p.295, 1912), &amp;ldquo;J&amp;rdquo; (1914), Mary Jay (1934). She has also been recorded as &amp;ldquo;Jane&amp;rdquo; as in Jane&amp;rsquo;s Grave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The report by William Crossing says that on 25th January 1851, Mr. James Bryant of Hedge Barton had the grave opened after it was found by workers tidying the area. Bones were found that were confirmed by a visiting doctor to be those of a young woman. They were reburied in a wooden box and the stones were placed to form the grave as it is seen today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Reprinting a Widecombe History Group item that was told by Beatrice Chase in the Western Morning News on 3rd March 1934:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A Workhouse apprentice hired out by the parish to Barracott Farm, Manaton. Hanged herself in a barn at Ford Farm. A parish register that recorded Apprentices 1804-1840 contained the name of Mary Jay among them, as well as the names of witnesses, overseer and assenting magistrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The father of Mr Robert Nosworthy, born at Ford &amp;ldquo;exactly one hundred years ago&amp;rdquo; (written in 1934, therefore born 1834), always spoke of her as Mary Jay, as did his great aunt, a generation back. Original OS maps had it labelled as Jay&amp;rsquo;s Grave but Mr John Kitson of Heatree had it changed to Jane&amp;rsquo;s Grave. His family agreed it should be reverted to Jay&amp;rsquo;s Grave (1937-1961 1:25k Series). OS 25-inch 1885/1886. The adjacent single sheet map has Swallerton Gate marked as Swinedown Gate.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Feldspar crystals indicate that the rock cooled slowly after it was formed. this example is probably plagioclase feldspar (ie of a family containing NaAlSi3O8 to CaAl2Si2O8 and usually white. The alternative would be an orthoclase feldspar (ie containing potassium KAlSi3O8 ) but those are usually pinkish in hur. In granite, quartz crystals are usually greyish and translucent.

&lt;p>The story of Bowerman is that many years ago he lived in the Manaton area and was a keen hunter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One day his hounds started a hare and he gave chase. He was so keen to catch the hare that he did not notice that the hounds had led him through a coven of witches, knocking over their cauldron. They were so incensed that they decided he must be punished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next time he was out hunting, one of the witches transformed herself into a white hare - a highly prized trophy. She led him the merriest chase of his life until he was near exhaustion. Then she led him and his hounds back to this spot where the other witches were waiting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They turned him into a pillar of granite as punishment, right here, where he must gaze out for all eternity on his favourite hunting lands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His hounds ran in fear for their lives but the witches turned on them as well, turning them to stone on a nearby hill - which is known today as &amp;ldquo;Hound Tor&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>This walk was reached by following the &amp;ldquo;Widecombe&amp;rdquo; sign from the A38 just past Ashburton, heading towards Exeter, via Owlacombe Cross, Halshanger Cross, turn right at Cold East Cross, left at Hemsworthy Gate after passing Rippon Tor on the right. Then, right at Harefoot Cross and on to the car park by Hound Tor, signed by the P symbol and yellow cross on the map.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
