&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is an interesting walk over open moorland taking in a wide scope of history, from Bronze age and medieval remains, to an abandoned Victorian railway, and disused granite quarries - all with excellent views over Dartmoor and West Devon into Cornwall. There&amp;rsquo;s a small detour offered which takes in an abandoned Medieval Longhouse, its modern replacement and two ancient Pounds and hut circles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Reaves - land boundaries of heaped stones&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are essentially four types of reaves:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Field boundaries to divide land into normally long strip-like fields for grazing or growing crops, akin to modern walls or hedges.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Terminal reaves that are uphill from field boundaries that marked lower divided areas from uphill open or &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; land&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reaves built usually along ridges to mark watersheds i.e. between river valleys&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Long divisions over kilometres marking out territories akin to parishes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The Walkhampton Common Reave is 3170 meters long and mostly straight. It was built in the Bronze Age (Between 4000 BC and 1000 BC), and forms a division between the Walkham and Meavy valleys, thus identifying it as a Reave of type 3 in the above list - built to separate two watersheds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The modern mast of North Hessary Tor transmitting station can be seen in the background. This was built in 1955 to supply 405-line television to Devon and is 196 meters (643 feet) tall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, it provides analogue FM radio covering a large area, including Devon, Cornwall, Somerset and South Wales.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, it provides Digital DAB radio and DVB-T television - and is a useful landmark to identify where Princetown is.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Heading Northwest from Leeden Tor, we very soon cross another reave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Great Western Reave measures over 10 kilometres in length and is the longest known prehistoric land division boundary on Dartmoor. This record covers the most southerly section of the reave (two sections measuring a combined length of 2.58 kilometres). Along its length, the width of the reave varies between 2.5 metres and 4 metres, whilst its height varies between 0.2 metres and 0.7 metres - although it would have been higher when built. A second reave leads off at right angles at SX5577 7088 and there are hut circles and cairns associated with the reave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This very long reave is a territorial boundary something akin to a modern parish boundary (and type 4 from the list above) It extends from near Sharpitor, near Dousland/Yelverton, to White Tor near Peter Tavy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This cist is described by Jeremy Butler, 1994, Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities Vol. 3 - The South-West, 16: Ingra Tor cairn and cist (fig. 45.13), page 51.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The cist is a few metres above the Routrundle leat, which is about 23 metres down the slope. The leat is marked by a downhill bank but is really quite non-photogenic and it is not easy to see the actual &amp;ldquo;trench&amp;rdquo; that was the water course in photographs, so it is not included here.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stone pits are generally places where walling or building stone was easily won from the ground because of natural fissures or weathering. Sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re mistaken for tinning holes where the old men would find small deposits of cassiterite - a rich source of tin ore. Those would usually have some spoil heaps nearby though, which aren&amp;rsquo;t evident here, so stone pits seems likely. The only two certain things about these holes however, is that they are impossible to date, and that they were made by man.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ingra Tor Quarry, like the nearby Swell Tor, King&amp;rsquo;s Tor and Foggintor Quarries, were run by the Johnson Brothers from 1820 to 1865 who paid a lease to the Duchy of Cornwall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was re-opened between 1936 and 1941 to cut kerbstones and granite setts for Devon County Council, and a platform was built on the railway called Ingra Tor Halt, just to the North of the Tor.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>This once held a small shelter from the elements, built partly inside a pound.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There was a short wooden platform to the single track railway.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At the time of opening in 1936, a single fare from here to Princetown was 11 1/2d First Class, or 7d Second Class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The halt was built for quarry workers, but when the quarries closed, was used exclusively by walkers, most coming up from Plymouth. Walking from here to Princetown and then riding back home was a popular route before the railway closed on March 3, 1956.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There was a famous sign here advising passengers to keep dogs on a lead due to the presence of adders. This sign is now kept at Buckfastleigh Station.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This bridge was built to provide safe passage for cattle and other livestock to cross the railway. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that the railway was fenced with posts and wire to keep stock off the line, so creeps like this were essential to allow free grazing under commoners rights.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This curious set of holes shows that this block was once used for a tramway in one of the nearby quarries. These holes held an iron plate which held the iron rails above it. Wear from those rails can be seen above and below. No longer of use there, it was re-used in constructing this creep.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This area of Dartmoor has been inhabited for at least four thousand years.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The earliest remains are the large circular pounds and nicely viewable via the aerial view below. This, together with the hut circles nearby, formed an early settlement around 4000 to 1000 BC and provide evidence of animal husbandry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To the Northwest are the stone ruins of a Medieval Longhouse, Smithy and other buildings built between 1066 and 1539.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Routrundle is the &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; farmhouse dating from a mere 1866, currently inhabited. Build after and probably to replace Babyland Longhouse. There are claims this house dates back to 1417, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible that is confused with the Babyland property.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Routrundle is no longer a working farm. It fell into disrepair and was left vacant after a Jim Fence left.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Routrundle&amp;rdquo; is named after the Bronze Age &amp;ldquo;trundles&amp;rdquo; or pounds still so visible today.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://media.onthemarket.com/properties/3992108/doc_0_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stags sales particulars (2018)&lt;/a> give a good view of the property, inside and out. It sold for £618,000 in 2018.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(Not pictured) There is a benchmark on the southwest side of the lane on a large boulder. SX55274 71832&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The collection of trees in the above photo marks a Bronze Age pound and collection of hut circles. These can be accessed from a Bridlepath off the railway a little further on, along with a Medieval Longhouse marked on the map as &amp;ldquo;homestead&amp;rdquo; a little way North of . This was called Babyland. This is a long-inhabited area of Dartmoor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The staining on the ground by metalliferous leaching indicates that there are metal ores in this vicinity. This particular mine was dug for Tin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adits are horizontal tunnels used in mining. Some are used for access in and out and some are used for draining upper levels of water. This one is only open for about 10 meters, and was worked in tandem with the shafts on the slope immediately above it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There would have been a spoil heap here when they were dug, but that has been removed by later activity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is one of two wheelpits found here and is the earliest, showing on the 1841 Tithe Map. A large waterwheel once ran here and was to drive a series of flat-rods back and forth motion which carried the power to the nearby quarry where it powered pumps to keep the water free of water, which at its end reached a depth of 130 feet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a second wheelpit just upstream but it is known that both were not used together. They ceased operation by 1905.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wheels were fed by a reservoir above and a wooden launder (a basic 3-sided chute to run water down) and were of &amp;ldquo;pitch back&amp;rdquo; design, where water was added to the top of the wheel so that it filled buckets and drove the wheel back towards the wooden launder that supplied water. It was found that one reservoir didn&amp;rsquo;t supply enough water as the needs of the quarry grew and a second was added to increase flow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Meldon Viaduct was built in 1874 by William Galbraith from wrought iron for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to connect Okehampton to Lydford and then on to Plymouth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was widened to double-track in 1879 by building a second viaduct alongside, this one of steel, and joining the two. This was in service until 1968 when it became yet another victim of the Beeching Cuts. Meldon Quarry continued to use it up until the 1980s for shunting its trains until the track was removed in 1990.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s now used by &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Granite_Way" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Granite Way&lt;/a> - a shared-use foot, cycle and bridlepath and is a scheduled monument.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These are some of the quarry&amp;rsquo;s waste dumps, more properly named as &amp;ldquo;finger dumps&amp;rdquo; for their shape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the late 1800s the &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo; was taken in trucks to a series of corrugated iron buildings at the northern end of the east side tramway. A transfer shed was used where the finished material was consigned to wagons operating on an incline leading to the London and South Western Rail sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct. This incline becomes apparent as an earthwork partially obscuring the mouth of the early lime kiln. The crushed stone was used as ballast on railways and roads across the country and any unsuitable stone ended up here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This old limestone quarry, now flooded. It was used to dig a special Carbonifereous period limestone, not found anywhere else on Dartmoor, and much prized for producing lime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pool is about 130 feet deep, and when worked was kept drained by pumps driven by the water wheels earlier on our walk. This makes it deeper than the viaduct is high, that being a mere 120 foot tall at its highest span.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hundred years ago this site will have been very noisy and busy, with explosions and cranes operating, horse drawn carts rumbling around and men shouting. There will also have been rock crushers and stamps running within earshot, as well as steam trains going over the railway.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lime kiln was built between 1880 and 1885.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lime was made in the kiln by setting alternating layers of limestone and charcoal made from coppiced hazel trees. Once the kiln was filled to the brim, the fire was lit and everything burned at a high temperature for three days, leaving behind quicklime, Calcium Oxide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slaked lime can be made, carefully, from lime by adding water. This process is called hydration and as the reaction is exothermic, a huge amount of heat is produced and this can be extremely dangerous. Quicklime was so named from the old word &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo;, as it acted like it was alive when water was added as it churned and boiled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once made, quick and slaked lime have many uses:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Agriculture&lt;/strong>: Increases the PH level of fields by being spread in powder form, transforming acidic soils into sweeter and more productive ground.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Construction&lt;/strong>: Lime Mortar has long been used for building, and is favoured even today for stone buildings instead of cement mortars, as it can move and even heal small cracks as it absorbs moisture. It&amp;rsquo;s also used as limewash for painting, and lime render to cover and stabilise walls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Manufacturing&lt;/strong>: Lime is used for all sorts of things, including paper, steel, sugar, paint and other processes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Medicine&lt;/strong>: In the right conditions, lime is also a disinfectant, and is used in purification methods.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This is the earlier kiln, built before an Okehampton Estate map of 1790 and originally serving a small nearby quarry. It became disused but was used again when the Meldon Pool quarry started up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is earliest building in the valley to exploit the local geology. The view is partially blocked by an inclined tramway that took quarried stone up to the railway viaduct, which was built in 1874.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Somewhere near to the turbine house there were once corrugated iron buildings that housed crushers. These worked previous spoil heaps, crushing limestone which was then loaded onto wagons on an incline that led to the railway sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This stone ruin was once where explosives for the quarry were kept. Before each shift, the explosives handler would take only enough from here for that shift&amp;rsquo;s operation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although the walls are strong, explosives stores often had very weak roofs - typically made of stick and oilcloth. If there was an accident, then the force would be sent upwards instead of outwards and repairs to the building would therefore be relatively quick.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These modern buildings are associated with more recent quarrying after 1921. The site remained open for a further fifty years until around 1970 and provided stone for road metalling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before these buildings, there was a failed glass bottle operation on this site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the late 19th century, investigations were being made concerning the production of granulite (a granular metamorphic rock) at Meldon. There seemed to be potential to establish both glass and china works at the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was little activity until 1920 when a syndicate from London decided to build a glass factory. Two furnaces were installed out of a planned 12, and about 500 men were required. However, by February 1921, the men had been laid off and new owners were being sought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No obvious features remain of a glass industry, but large amounts of broken glass fragments can be seen, mostly representing small medicine and cosmetic bottles. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; (Western Morning News 29/03/1920&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This spillway appears to be a combination of a straight chute and stepped spillway features. These are designed to reduce the kinetic energy of overflowing water and thereby reduce erosion damage. This system is essentially an uncontrolled system in that there are no mechanical gates or vanes to regulate the rate of overflow at the top of the dam.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In 1836 Ralph Lopes leased the area to George Stone Baron to &amp;lsquo;dig work mine and search for Iron, Iron Ore, Iron Stone and all other Ores&amp;rsquo; on what was then called Great Yennadon Common, the rent being 1s 8d in the on the gross value according to the price on the day of all such ores metals and minerals which shall be &amp;hellip; digged raised and gotten out of from or in the said premises&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There was no lease following this, so it must be concluded the venture was unsuccessful. In 1846, another license was issued to other adventurers!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The horse-drawn tramway consisted of short wagons that could be pulled in quite a tight turn. The line enters this image at the far right, from the gateway seen above, swings around a hairpin bend (kindly marked by the sheep) and doubles back towards the camera at the left, from where it goes through the first gate above up to Iron Mine Lane and on to Princetown via the west side of the Down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steam railway could not turn a tight bend like this and was built running into this image at the bottom left and on into the distance towards the reservoir where it ran around the flank of the Down above the dam to Burrator &amp;amp; Sheepstor Halt and then on to Princetown, travelling up the east side of the Down.&lt;/p>

A rough-hewn short pillar standing against the eastern enclosure wall 20 yards north of the wall corner, in exactly the position in which the last stone on the northern boundary was indicated on the 1836 map (see above)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This grass triangle is no burial place - it is a triangular piece of land that was left so that a horse and cart could negotiate a fork in the road where three lanes meet; or maybe it built up from these cart and wagon turnings over the centuries: this is called a godcake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The so-called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Godcake" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
