&lt;p>The staining on the ground by metalliferous leaching indicates that there are metal ores in this vicinity. This particular mine was dug for Tin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adits are horizontal tunnels used in mining. Some are used for access in and out and some are used for draining upper levels of water. This one is only open for about 10 meters, and was worked in tandem with the shafts on the slope immediately above it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There would have been a spoil heap here when they were dug, but that has been removed by later activity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is one of two wheelpits found here and is the earliest, showing on the 1841 Tithe Map. A large waterwheel once ran here and was to drive a series of flat-rods back and forth motion which carried the power to the nearby quarry where it powered pumps to keep the water free of water, which at its end reached a depth of 130 feet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a second wheelpit just upstream but it is known that both were not used together. They ceased operation by 1905.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wheels were fed by a reservoir above and a wooden launder (a basic 3-sided chute to run water down) and were of &amp;ldquo;pitch back&amp;rdquo; design, where water was added to the top of the wheel so that it filled buckets and drove the wheel back towards the wooden launder that supplied water. It was found that one reservoir didn&amp;rsquo;t supply enough water as the needs of the quarry grew and a second was added to increase flow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This second wheelpit housed a water wheel some 18 foot in diameter. The walls are better preserved than the first but quite overgrown. Behind it, there is a depression which is a &amp;ldquo;bob-pit&amp;rdquo;. This housed a large counter-weight which kept tension on the flat-rods as they worked to operate the quarry pumps.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Meldon Viaduct was built in 1874 by William Galbraith from wrought iron for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) to connect Okehampton to Lydford and then on to Plymouth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was widened to double-track in 1879 by building a second viaduct alongside, this one of steel, and joining the two. This was in service until 1968 when it became yet another victim of the Beeching Cuts. Meldon Quarry continued to use it up until the 1980s for shunting its trains until the track was removed in 1990.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s now used by &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Granite_Way" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Granite Way&lt;/a> - a shared-use foot, cycle and bridlepath and is a scheduled monument.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These are some of the quarry&amp;rsquo;s waste dumps, more properly named as &amp;ldquo;finger dumps&amp;rdquo; for their shape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the late 1800s the &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo; was taken in trucks to a series of corrugated iron buildings at the northern end of the east side tramway. A transfer shed was used where the finished material was consigned to wagons operating on an incline leading to the London and South Western Rail sidings on the eastern edge of Meldon Viaduct. This incline becomes apparent as an earthwork partially obscuring the mouth of the early lime kiln. The crushed stone was used as ballast on railways and roads across the country and any unsuitable stone ended up here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This old limestone quarry, now flooded. It was used to dig a special Carbonifereous period limestone, not found anywhere else on Dartmoor, and much prized for producing lime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pool is about 130 feet deep, and when worked was kept drained by pumps driven by the water wheels earlier on our walk. This makes it deeper than the viaduct is high, that being a mere 120 foot tall at its highest span.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hundred years ago this site will have been very noisy and busy, with explosions and cranes operating, horse drawn carts rumbling around and men shouting. There will also have been rock crushers and stamps running within earshot, as well as steam trains going over the railway.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The carts of finished stone were weighed here before leaving for the railway. The design would have been similar to modern weighbridges and these metal grids formed the top layer of weighing scales that were read from within the weigh house. The quarry will have recorded its output using these figures, and from that set prices charged and paid.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lime kiln was built between 1880 and 1885.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lime was made in the kiln by setting alternating layers of limestone and charcoal made from coppiced hazel trees. Once the kiln was filled to the brim, the fire was lit and everything burned at a high temperature for three days, leaving behind quicklime, Calcium Oxide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slaked lime can be made, carefully, from lime by adding water. This process is called hydration and as the reaction is exothermic, a huge amount of heat is produced and this can be extremely dangerous. Quicklime was so named from the old word &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo;, as it acted like it was alive when water was added as it churned and boiled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once made, quick and slaked lime have many uses:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Agriculture&lt;/strong>: Increases the PH level of fields by being spread in powder form, transforming acidic soils into sweeter and more productive ground.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Construction&lt;/strong>: Lime Mortar has long been used for building, and is favoured even today for stone buildings instead of cement mortars, as it can move and even heal small cracks as it absorbs moisture. It&amp;rsquo;s also used as limewash for painting, and lime render to cover and stabilise walls.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Manufacturing&lt;/strong>: Lime is used for all sorts of things, including paper, steel, sugar, paint and other processes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Medicine&lt;/strong>: In the right conditions, lime is also a disinfectant, and is used in purification methods.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>These modern buildings are associated with more recent quarrying after 1921. The site remained open for a further fifty years until around 1970 and provided stone for road metalling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before these buildings, there was a failed glass bottle operation on this site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the late 19th century, investigations were being made concerning the production of granulite (a granular metamorphic rock) at Meldon. There seemed to be potential to establish both glass and china works at the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was little activity until 1920 when a syndicate from London decided to build a glass factory. Two furnaces were installed out of a planned 12, and about 500 men were required. However, by February 1921, the men had been laid off and new owners were being sought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No obvious features remain of a glass industry, but large amounts of broken glass fragments can be seen, mostly representing small medicine and cosmetic bottles. &lt;cite>&amp;ndash; (Western Morning News 29/03/1920&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Meldon Dam was begun in 1970 and completed in 1974, making it the newest of Dartmoor&amp;rsquo;s large dams.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is 55 meters (180 feet) high.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s 200 meters (660 feet) wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The reservoir is stocked with Brown Trout for licenced angling.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Uniquely, Meldon reservoir became the first water-supply body to produce electricity when a 500kW turbine generator was installed in 1987 to produce electricity to work the pumps and treatment works.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This spillway appears to be a combination of a straight chute and stepped spillway features. These are designed to reduce the kinetic energy of overflowing water and thereby reduce erosion damage. This system is essentially an uncontrolled system in that there are no mechanical gates or vanes to regulate the rate of overflow at the top of the dam.&lt;/p>
