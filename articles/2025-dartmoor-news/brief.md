Maybe you could write a walking article for a future issue of the Dartmoor News using Keith's route and photo? Up 500 words with some photos, you can plug the web site too. What do you think?

Fairly easy on style,
say up 500 words with 3or 4 photos. A list of the starting point/ length/ a rough idea of the ground walking over/miles etc we can put the start.

= Haytor Walk

A brief introduction of the Haytor Walk with key points (distance, history, conditions). 3 or 4 pictures. 
a mention of the website and Keith.
