A walk around Haytor and its Quarries

A three mile stroll around the iconic Haytor and across open moor to visit the tranquil Haytor Quarries, Granite Tramway and lots of other interesting things. There is an optional detour down to Holwell Quarry that adds a mile and a bit of a hill.



The full walk with some 60 photographs and a detailed map is available freely at https://dartmoorwalking.org/haytor    This is a new website aiming to encourage people to enjoy and learn about Dartmoor and its unique history. There are over thirty walks already, each one providing a useful self-guided map and details of interesting points along the way. Parking information is provided, together with a map of Dartmoor showing where each walk is sorted by area and length, and a GPX file of each trail.
