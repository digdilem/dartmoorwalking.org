## Introduction

This walk takes us over open moorland amongst bronze age hut circles, burial cists and other ancient remains.

## Sheeps Tor

*Follow the wide track East, over the stream and left of the Scout Hut, before leave it when we reach the Corn Ditch Wall*

## Corn Ditch Wall

A Corn Ditch Wall is an artificial barrier separating grazing land and the common moorland. 

Where it differs from a normal wall is that the land approaching it from the moor side is steep and difficult to negotiate, but the earth on the other side ramps up to its top. This is to allow animals to leave the richer farm grazing and venture forth onto the moor.

## Cuckoo Rock

![Cuckoo Rock to the North East of the cist. At SX 58470 68723](8.jpg)

The name is said to come from this being the place where a local farmer always heard the first cuckoo, although one can also believe that it looks like a cuckoo's egg in a nest of small eggs.

It was once a tradition for young boys to climb this rock, which is a bit of a struggle.

## Shaft

![A filled-in gateway with Down Tor behind](9.jpg)

Just to the right of this and behind the wall, is a mine shaft that's marked "Shaft" on the map.

## Adit

![Just North of the Shaft at SX 57762 68394 is an old adit](10.jpg)

*Tip: To find this adit, cross the second stile going north from the corner of the forest. A path leads down to the left, look for running water draining from the adit. It is a few yards from the stile. Then return here and progress West*

## PCWW Boundary Stone

These boundary stones mark the point where rainfall will end up in the Burrator Reservoir. They encircle the whole of the catchment area and are marked PCWW for "Plymouth City Water Works"

## Longstone Leat

## Yellowmean Multiple Stone Circle

![Yellowmead Multiple Stone circle](16.jpg)

These stone circles were rediscovered in 1921 when covering heather was burnt off during a drought, and the rings re-erected. It is possible that they were not replaced in the correct positions.

There is also some evidence for a double stone row at this point.
