## Introduction

This walk starts near the famous Warren House Inn and descends into the Redwater valley, home to many ancient tin workings and four distinct tin mines which were combined in 1845. This was a major industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries employing hundreds of people, and many ruins and reminders remain. The main route is firm and easy going, with a gentle hill on the final climb back to the car park.

Note: The track along the valley, although firm underfoot, is often very wet all year round. Sensible footwear recommended.

Do feel free to explore the area and leave our track - there are many points of interest, some of which we've marked on the map and all are worth exploring.

## The Four Aces

![Across the Valley](1.jpg)

From the parking, on a clear day, you can see three rock walled enclosures across the valley. Together with a fourth (see map, central), these are known as the "Four Aces" or "The Devil's Playing Cards". 

> Legend tells...
> Jan Reynolds was a tin miner from Widecombe who was more interested in drinking and gambling than in going to church on a Sunday. Finding himself short of money he made a deal with the Devil: in return for money to fund his gambling the Devil could have his soul if he was found asleep in church.
> 
> Jan soon forgot the pact and one Sunday he fell asleep while playing cards in church. There was a sound of horsesâ€™ hooves outside, and a flash of lightning so fierce that it tore off the top of the church tower, then the Devil strode into the church and snatched up the terrified miner, carrying him up into the sky and across the moor. Jan had four aces in his hand and he dropped them in what is now known as the Aces Field.

One can quite clearly see a diamond shape, but it taxes the imagination to see the shape of a Heart, a Club and a Spade in these fields.

The reality of these enclosures is that they were either to keep rabbits in or rabbits out. The farm just over the hill to the Easy is Headland Warren Farm, which was known to breed rabbits which formed a large part of the miner's diet. I'm unclear whether the rabbits were kept in these enclosures, or they were built for growing crops which needed protecting.

*Take the path Eastwards into the valley for about half a mile*

## Vitifer Mine

*Also known as Vityfer*

![The path approaching Vitifer Mine](2.jpg)

Many of the paths in this area are formed of growan - decomposed granite - which makes for good walking.

![Looking down the grassy path at the Vitifer Mine site. Birch Tor can be seen on the horizon, top left](3.jpg)

This area contains the remains of four distinct mines:

1. Vitifer (Prev: Vytifer) Mine
2. Birch Tor Mine
3. Easy Birch Tor Mine (AKA Headland Mine)
4. Golden Dagger Mine. 

Vitifer and Birch Tor were separate mines originally, then combined, then separated, and then combined again.  Naming of these two seems interchangeable, with both workings being known by both names.

![A view across the Vitifer site up to Birch Tor. The enclosures are marked as "gardens" in the tithe apportionments, behind the ruins of the miners' house, this being the barracks with the kitchen and canteen (downstairs) and the dormitory (upstairs)](4.jpg)

![The circular stump of the chimney](5.jpg)

The chimney was  between the blacksmith's shop and the miners' dry - and the wall of the carpenter's shop at extreme left, with Challacombe Down behind.

![Rex's Bridge (SX 68186 80977) on the left, with the Blacksmith's shop ruins central](6.jpg)

![The chimney base again, with a flue leading away to the left](7.jpg)

The flue here runs underneath and heated what was the "Miner's dry" - a place where miners would hang their clothes, soaked from working underground in dripping and partially flooded adits and stopes. 

A fireplace or boiler would have been placed at the far end of the flue, and the smoke run through it to the chimney, which released it high enough not to bother those at ground level.

![Some of the partially uncovered flue, plus an iron peg](8.jpg)

![SX 6815 8091 - the site of the turbine house (bottom right) and a large water wheelpit (left side)](9.jpg)

The turbine house does not appear in the 1904 OS map, so was likely built after that.

![The now empty leat above the wheelpit which once fed it](10.jpg)

These mines were powered mostly by water, by the Birch Tor and Vitifer Mine Leat which travelled for 7 miles. 

![The wheelpit where once a waterwheel turned, providing power - likely for to the blacksmith and carpenter's shops](11.jpg)

Large waterwheels were used here for pumping out water, raising ore from shafts and driving the crushing stamps. 

Smaller waterwheels were used for other work, such as driving the "sweeps" that swept the crushed ore on the buddles at the lower edge of the workings.

## Golden Dagger Mine

![Looking down the path towards Golden Dagger mine. This track is rarely dry](17.jpg)

This mine was named after a bronze dagger was found here from the early men who lived here four thousand years ago. 

The dagger was taken to Plymouth Museum, and rumoured to have been destroyed during World War 2 bombing of that building. 

A replica dagger is owned by DNPA and can sometimes be seen at their information centres and displays.

This area was mined for Tin from at least the fifteenth century via surface streaming. 

Mines were dug to chase tin further underground from around the 1750s. Given the amount of surface water in this area, one imagines these were very wet mines and hard to keep dewatered. 

The underground workings ended in 1914 when many men were drafted for the First World War. Some surface working remained until 1939 when again, the needs of war took labour away from the moors.

## Dinah's House

![Dinah's House, SX 68465 80048, the wheelpit above is about halfway along the track in this photograph, on the same side of the track as the house](26.jpg)

![This was the Mine Captain's house and office, officially Stamps Cottage](27.jpg)

This building was so named because Dinah Hext and her children lived here in 1860s and 1870s, having moved a short way up the valley from Challacombe. 

"CEH 1832" in cement on lower side, southern end of the house.  It was also apparently once a dormitory (Called a "barracks") and meeting place for miners.

## Buddle

![Across the track and a short way downhill - a buddle](32.jpg)

A buddle is a simple structure to separate material out by its density. 

Fine sediment is introduced at the centre point by trough or pipe in suspension with water. As it flows towards the outer edge, heavier material is deposited first. 

Some buddles are assisted by rotary brushes. 

Once sufficient sediment has built up, it is shovelled out with the "headings" containing the more valuable minerals in the centre, and the less valuable or waste known as "tailings" towards the edge.

This one is known to have been fed by a slurry onto the cone by a small leat arrangement and swept by a waterwheel-driven "wood and rags sweeps"

*This is the far point of our walk - we must return along the same track and view the workings from a different angle*

There is hard parking at the given coordinates which lead directly into our walk.
