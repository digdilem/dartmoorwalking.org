## Introduction

*This walk was reached by finding the Pork Hill car park on the road between Tavistock and Two Bridges, marked by the  P  symbol and yellow cross on the map. This is a large car park on the south side of the road.*

The following bound stones are part of the group of eight stones along an ancient reeve, described by Dave Brewer (2002) Dartmoor Boundary Markers, Halsgrove, pp. 195-196. Seven are RB stones along the Peter Tavy / Whitchurch boundary and there is another, not on the boundary. The most westerly one, no. 1, is no longer to be found. The "R" probably refers to the Radcliffes of Warleigh, former owners of seven farms in the area.

## PW Stone

![PW stone, at SX 53453 75952 ..... this is the stone described by Dave Brewer(2002) Dartmoor Boundary Markers, Halsgrove, pp. 158 thus, after describing the stones above: "The line then bends north-easwards to a Boundary Rock near Beckamoor Head at SX 5345 7595 called Flat Rock or Black Rock bearing the letters 'P' and 'W' on the appropriate sides of its flat top" - P signifying Peter Tavy and W signifying Whitchurch parishes. The 'W' can be seen (upside-down) on the far edge of the stone, opposite the 'P'](14.jpg)
