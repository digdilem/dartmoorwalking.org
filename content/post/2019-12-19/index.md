## Introduction

This is a walk of two distinct halves. To start with, we leave the car park and are immediately embraced by the rich woodland surrounding Burrator Reservoir. A short climb through this woodland and the path opens out onto open moorland with the imposing gray shape of Sheeps Tor and it's jumbled mass of granite always within sight. Our path leads around the Tor, investigating several Bronze Age hut circles, other ancient relics such as gateways, waymarking stones, a vermin trap, a distant stone circle and some great views to Great Mis Tor, over Burrator Reservoir and wider vistas. 

No visit to Sheeps Tor would be complete without investigating Pixies' House - which has entranced generations of OS Map readers with its evocative name!

Alternatively, there is a shorter circular walk of around half a mile that is produced and signposted by Dartmoor National Park and skips the longer walk around Sheeps Tor.  This is part of DNP's "Miles without Stiles" project and is considered accessible, with good, flat paths and easy grades.

## Burrator Arboretum

![Notice in the Arboretum car park](1.jpg)

* Burrator Arboretum is a Nature reserve with woodlands, meadows, ponds and footpaths which is designed to be accessible. 
* It was planted in the late 1980s after storms caused damage in the areas. (The editor spent many years working in Forestry clearing up after these storms and remembers them well!)
* Its purpose is to create a collection of native and non-native tree speecies, develop wetlands and ponds, increase biodiversity and provide easy access for visitors, especially those who might struggle with more rugged terrain. 
* It is maintained by South West Lakes Trust

This stile is followed quickly by a second beside a pair of locked gates as we leave the arboretum and emerge onto Yellowmead Down

**Tip!** The path used here is through the entry gate and turn right, next turn left, proceed, go straight across a cross-paths junction, proceed, turn right, proceed - almost coming back on yourself. Lastly - turn left and see the stile.
