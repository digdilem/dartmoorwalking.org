## By Car

These walks are mostly set to be reached by private car. Car parks are identified on the maps and directions given to them. A car gives you freedom to choose your route and time, and is the most practical way to reach Dartmoor walks. 

## Public Transport

* [Dartmoor National Park Authority maintains a page about public transport](https://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/enjoy-dartmoor/planning-your-visit/travel-information)
* [Visit Dartmoor also provide useful information on reaching parts of Dartmoor by public transport](https://visitdartmoor.co.uk/key-information/train-and-bus-connections/)
